This account is solely meant for deposits from ssi for back payments After a year and 2 installment payments we were anticipating the 3rd and final installment from social security. Due to covid -19 pandemic social security did not deposit the 3rd installment on XX/XX/XXXX which was the expected date. I had a check to cash at wellsfargo for financial aid so i went into to speak with the banker i told him how i recieved the information from social security about the deposit expected to be late due to being backlogged and the fee that was assessed to my account after just resolving it. He told me the fee bringing the account to a negative would not affect the deposit. The week following the deposit wasnt there So i returned to the bank branch where i opened the account and told them the problem and how it didnt have a check mark for direct deposit as services we had and offered to clear the fee assessed to the account in case that would disrupt the account in good standing and the substantial deposit we are expecting i wasnt too sure about the rules tho concerned about ssi policies for deposits made to account i was assured once again by the banker the account was available and ready for the deposit and not to take care of the fee because the seposit from ssi would take care of it and the deposit wouldnt be affected by it. I told the banker once again they were backlogged and the deposit would be late she assured me the account would be ready 3 days later they closed the account due to inactivity and a negative balance i called and the representative told me the account would be back open in 3 days but no we are XXXX because wells fargo lied to us
2021-02-08,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I have been investigating my own credit reporting accounts myself after getting generic responses from them and the lack of investigation on their parts. I was receiving berries when I clearly knew the account was fraud, paid or inaccurate and reporting inaccurately continuously with no proof of debt validation required by Federal Law. They never stated how, they got the information either. Just falsely reports. I took matters in my own hands and now the COMPANY that stated I had a debt even requests removal! This is how I became very suspect and frustrated at the credit reporting agency inaccuracies. I know am about to file small claims court if the other accounts are not fixed I investigated and found not accurate either! Also an account was paid off and reporting inaccuracies that Im late! Proof attached! 

They have report XXXX XXXX  Account and this account is not even mine. The company themselves stated the social security number they have isnt even mine so how are they not removing this inaccurate account? 
XXXX  XXXX  was already contacted by the original creditor to remove the accounts XXXX XXXX  was found inaccurate and reported this Experian found inaccurate XXXX XXXX was a medial bill in HIPPA Violation and removed from all credit reports but XXXX  XXXX was found inaccurate only XXXX reports this account XXXX  XXXX  XXXX was paid off trains in full and on time Experian - hasnt update files since XX/XX/2020 Still didnt remove inquires that were not authorized by me and inaccuracies reported XXXX just update but still reporting a medial bull that the XXXX XXXX asked to remove themselves because they were in HIPPA violation and all agencies removed but XXXX  XXXX - Continues to report inaccuracies and also sends same generic report responses They have not removed all the credit inquires I send to them that were not authorized by me They are all inconsistent and not reporting accurate. They are not reporting debt validation. Its been over 120 days since I have provided proof on all these accounts inaccurate. 


This is my final attempt to have the agencies do their jobs by law and protecting my rights and credit with all these inconsistencies and inaccuracies.

2021-02-10,Credit card or prepaid card,"I believe SYNCHRONY BANK violated 15 usc 1691 ( d ) ( 6 ) For purposes of this subsection, the term adverse action means a denial or revocation of credit, a change in the terms of an existing credit arrangement, or a refusal to grant credit in substantially the amount or on substantially the terms requested. Such term does not include a refusal to extend additional credit under an existing credit arrangement where the applicant is delinquent or otherwise in default, or where such additional credit would exceed a previously established credit limit. In my case SYNCHRONY BANK revoked my credit. Shown in exhibits.

I believe SYNCHRONY BANK is civilly liable for their action 15 USC 1691e ( b ) Any creditor, other than a government or governmental subdivision or agency, who fails to comply with any requirement imposed under this subchapter shall be liable to the aggrieved applicant for punitive damages in an amount not greater than {$10000.00}, in addition to any actual damages provided in subsection ( a ), except that in the case of a class action the total recovery under this subsection shall not exceed the lesser of {$500000.00} or 1 per centum of the net worth of the creditor. In determining the amount of such damages in any action, the court shall consider, among other relevant factors, the amount of any actual damages awarded, the frequency and persistence of failures of compliance by the creditor, the resources of the creditor, the number of persons adversely affected, and the extent to which the creditors failure of compliance was intentional. Shown in exhibits.

Fact, SYNCHRONY BANK did not get authorization from me the original creditor pursuant to 15 usc 1602 ( g ) to close my account and take my credit away pursuant to 15 usc 1602 ( f ). I believe the credit grantor/debtor does not have the same authority as the original creditor. Shown in exhibits.

Fact, SYNCHRONY BANK violated 15 usc 1602 ( p ) unauthorized use of my credit card which is my social security card 15 usc 1602 ( l ) because I did not benefit from the consumer credit transaction that I authorized on XX/XX/XXXX. I believe SYNCHRONY BANK is criminally liable for their actions pursuant to 15 usc 1611 ( 1 ) willful and knowing the original creditor did not give authorization to close account. Shown in exhibits.

This is my second affidavit of truth being served to Synchrony Bank my first affidavit has been ignored. File uploaded will include my first and second affidavit."

They also informed me that they will automatically mail me out a letter stating that it had been paid in full. Once I made the final payment on XXXX XXXX and I did not recieve anything in mail after a week I called the debt collector and asked them why I had not recieved anything in mail and thats when they told me that I had toc all and request that.

To my surprise I did not get accurate information. Also, to have it removed or deleted the representative told me that it was something that was available upon request which I did request However, only to find out that this has not been removed or deleted from my credit. The last report showed that it was indeed paid in full but also as an active account which is not the truth.

When I spoke to XXXX at XXXX today, she told me that they now require me to send them a copy of my social security number, my driver 's license, and a copy of a utility bill. I told her that they never requested that information before and asked her if I sent them the additional documents if they would immediately remove the inquiry from my report and she was not able to guarantee me that they would. I told her that the information they are requesting is very sensitive and I do not feel comfortable releasing this information to a company that has not been authorized to receive this information and they could use it to further steal my identity now that they have a copy of my social security card, driver 's license, and utility bill. How can I be sure that they are not part of the identity theft scam?

Lets take a look at section 15 U.S. Code 1681 and see

what Congress has to say about this section : ( a ) Accuracy and fairness of credit reporting The Congress makes the following findings

: ( 1 ) The banking system is dependent upon fair and accurate credit reporting. Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system.

( 2 ) An elaborate mechanism has been developed for investigating and evaluating the credit worthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, character, and general reputation of consumers.

( 3 ) Consumer reporting agencies have assumed a vital role in assembling and evaluating consumer credit and other information on consumers.

( 4 ) There is a need to insure that consumer reporting agencies exercise their grave responsibilities with fairness, impartiality, and a respect for the consumers right to privacy. Now lets look at another section of the FCRA 15 U.S. Code 1681b and see whats being said in that section : ( a ) In general Subject to subsection ( c ), any consumer reporting agency may furnish a consumer report under the following circumstances and no other : ( 1 ) In response to the order of a court having jurisdiction to issue such an order, or a subpoena issued in connection with proceedings before a Federal grand jury. 
( 2 ) In accordance with the written instructions of the consumer to whom it relates. As a Consumer, a couple things stood out. First I never provided written instructions as is required under 15 U.S. Code 1681b to any Consumer Reporting Agency to furnish my reports, and by doing so without that permissible purpose, you have damaged my reputation and infringed upon my right to privacy as a federally protected Consumer."

Given the current pandemic, there is no way we will be able to travel to XXXX for the foreseeable future. We have contacted the merchant on several occasions and were informed we would have a year to claim our credit.

As you may know, Mexico has seen an increasing rise of COVID cases totaling around 408,499 confirmed, with some experts estimating the real figures closer to 7 million, given testing limitations.

To explain, XXXX XXXX continued to charge me for the annual fee even though I had already paid them the fee. Every month from XXXX to XXXX they reported a missed payment to all three credit bureaus. They apologized for their mistake and ensure me that they will contact the credit bureau to remove all the negative marks they put on my account as this was their negligence for not verifying their information about my account. It is now XX/XX/XXXX ( I spoke to them XXXX XXXX ) and the missed payment has not been removed. I also open a dispute with Experian and Experian said they refuse to remove it. It seems like the only thing left to do is to take them to court because they are violating the federal fair credit reporting act ( FCRA ) and has damaged my creditworthiness."

Ally Financial is also unfairly sending a negative report to credit bureaus.

I have included in this complaint : a record of my first email exchange with XXXX customer service, my second email exchange with XXXX customer service. My email exchange with the U. S. Department of Transportation, my second claim letter to my creditor, and the U.S. Department of Transportations original mandate that justifies my claim to a full refund. 

As I argued in my original claim, XXXX canceled my flight due to COVID-19 complications. They initially tried to offer a voucher as a form of reimbursement. After I replied that I was due a full refund and that this refund is mandatory per the Department of Transportations enforcement notice, they requested my account information to transfer my refund. They then promptly cut off all communication with me and did not reply to my emails. 

After originally opening my dispute, both XXXX and my creditor argued that the refund terms were fulfilled and that I was not owed a refund. They claimed that the merchant has a no refund cancelation policy therefore I am not owed anything. This completely ignores the DOT enforcement that I included in my dispute claim. XXXX has also failed to respond to my DOT complaint within the required window of time, indicating they have no intention of interacting with me in good faith as a merchant. Furthermore, my creditor is obligated to credit this amount as it is considered a billing error under USC Title 15, Chapter 41, Subchapter 1 Part D Section 1666 ( b ) ( 3 ).

This is a difficult request to fulfill in the era of COVID as I, like many, do not have easy access to a printer. Furthermore, Experian did not provide an email address through which I could submit copies of the required information. One can apply for credit from a bank completely electronically ; however the same can not be said about unfreezing your credit with Experian. 

Moreover, Experian 's customer service hotline pushes users to automated prompts and does not give one the option the speak with an actual human being about this problem.

I would like Experian to have an easy way to interact with actual people on their customer service hotline ( as opposed to automated prompts ) to talk to someone about unfreezing my credit by means other than paper mail during a time when many people simply do not or can not easily get access to paper documents.

She said the policy was changed as a result of many of these types of mishaps and they now require both signatures. According to Sec 94.053 both tenant and landlord must sign the lease and in Sec 94.055 it states if you they don't receive any communication from the tenant, then the renewal could be modified if the tenant remains on the property. Their renewal even states that the renewal must be signed by the tenant. If I was the tenant, then why was I not required to sign it? The Texas Property code doesnt say the property management has the right to renew a lease without the signature of the tenant but it does allow you to modify the renewal ( change rent, etc. )"

Meanwhile, my credit report with them is unlocked, and my credit is unprotected!

I called customer service, and they told me what had happened and suggested that I go speak to the manager of the bank branch where I had opened the account, who should be able to lift the freeze. 

When I went to the bank to see the manager, I was accompanied by my two granddaughters, who are XXXX. The manager stared at them, and it was obvious to me that because he was white, he was making a XXXX judgment on me ( I'm also white ) for having XXXX grandchildren. He was very rude to me and told me that because the deposit I made was returned, it caused several checks I had written to bounce. Although the account was not overdrawn, because I had bounced a check in the first 30 days, he said that bank had to close my account. The manager returned to me the money that was still in the account, and closed it during my visit. He assured me that there would be no negative reporting ramifications from the closure, as it was not my fault. 

Recently, I attempted to open an account with a different bank and was denied. I obtained a copy of my ChexSystems Report ( as recommended by the denying bank ) to see why I had been denied, and I noted that XXXX  XXXX XXXX had reported me to ChexSystems in 2017, indicating they had closed my account due to "" suspected fraud ''. This is completely inaccurate. The ChexSystems report also indicated that I had an unpaid amount owed to XXXX as a result of the closed account, which is also inaccurate. 

I contacted XXXX several times to request that they remove the false information from ChexSystems, but the customer service reps I spoke with said they were unable to do so, but could not provide me any valid reason why ( as they agreed with me as to why my account had been closed and confirmed I did not owe XXXX any money ).

Well Fargo has an internal policy, that lines up with XXXX XXXX app to purposefully delay the posting to an account to create fees on both sides as they point to one another as the cause. 

I personally don't care to dig through red tampon tape as my business partners bleed me. Like XXXX. 

So, When I called to fix it, they gave me a breakdown of my transactions. As if that's not why I'm calling. 

Then, XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX became hostile. Screaming and yelling, but she is the Consumer Advocate? How? 

Regardless, Wells Fargo explicitly allowed me to enroll on overdraft protection, only to ake sure I overdraft and have to use the protections "" offered. '' Its a ponzi scheme, set in timetables of due dates on wires and funds, and most of the time they target people they know wont fight them on the fee. I'm not that person. 

WF protection program entitled me to up to the date news on my disputes as well as, what I understood in the terms, a good faith promise to investigate a dispute within the wheelhouse of the program. 

Today, XXXX refused to take my fee dispute against XXXX. Initially, she offered to transfer me to claims, then she said she didn't have anyone, then she said she could look into it, then she said what I was looking for, then proceeded to deny ever offering me a chance to speak with claims. It was a runaround. I just got off their recorded line maybe 10 minutes ago. 

Additionally, with regards to the XXXX claim, worth XXXX. The protection program states it will keep you updated on disputes throughout the process. When I submitted the XXXX dispute, on the same day, I submitted an Audible dispute with the exact same claims and underlying basis for the claim. 

Unclear Terms and Conditions. 
I did not sign up for this, based on those terms, I understood x, but they only mentioned y. 

This line of reasoning entitled me to XXXX bucks back from XXXX. 
But from XXXX, it lost out on the same day? Exact same baseline facts? Exact same underlying issues. Except XXXX is up and coming and they don't want to risk it. 

Regardless, you notice the problem with the fact set? I'm only mentioned as the person doing th eleg work to make the protection program, protect me?

Again, no limits had been communicated to me or my co-signer, despite me making an additional request in XXXX to extend. 

When I inquired when/why these changes places to place, it took speaking to the XXXX to get an answer that wasn't "" you need to pay these to bring them current ... that's all we know '' and I waited an additional 15 days to be told they had no intention of acknowledging their lack of compassion, communication, or damage to my credit report. In addition to catching them rack fees in my account and being issued a refund for multiple instances of these fee assessments, I believe Wells Fargo is a predatory bank that should be investigated. 

They are resolving themselves of their place in the student debt crisis and selling their student loan accounts to a third party -- leaving thousands of us with loans nearly in default to instead deal with collection agencies where additional fees will be added. 

This is unfair, inaccurate, and it should be examined further to prevent Wells Fargo from further profiting from it's predation."

Experian sees the inaccurate information that XXXX  XXXX is reporting, but Experian credit reporting agency refused to remove and delete the inaccurate information from my credit file and credit report which are against the XXXX  rules. 

I have kindly requested, Experian to remove and delete the inaccurate information that is reported on the credit report. Experian has failed to knowledge my request. When a creditor reviews individual credit report, the identity / personal information such as name, address, telephone number and all personal information on the credit report must match. 
Which best describes your problem? 
The inaccurate item name XXXX  XXXX is listed on my Experian credit report. Does not match my identity/ personal information ; this is described as inaccurate information. Experian has listed XXXX  XXXX on my credit file which is inaccurate information and the information reported does not match to my identity/ person information and continues to report and leave XXXX  XXXX inaccurate information on my credit report. Based on credit bureaus responsibility to report only information accurate information. Experian has continued to leave inaccurate information that does not match my identity on my credit report and has failed to remove the inaccurate information from my credit file, this has negatively impacted me on many levels"

Which is a complete un-true statement. I contacted them about a fraudXX/XX/XXXX that they have since rectified. However they only acknowledged one of those request and it took 2 times so I believe the confused the two. I was told that since it was opened under fraud it can not be canceled and I have to wait. So I asked for a manager and was not provided one. Experian need to cancel the dispute as I have active accounts withXX/XX/XXXX and this can interfere with them.

2021-02-07,Credit card or prepaid card,"I am furious. My credit card numbers were stolen and 58 fraudulent charges were made on my account ( {$3300.00} in total ). I promptly advised Citi of the theft. I spent over an hour on the phone going over the false charges and was assured they would cancel/reverse the fraudulent charges. A replacement card was sent out and Citi immediately cancelled the card. 

A week later Citi had a person call me who spoke absolutely no English. I tried to go over the charges/fraud again. He did not understand a thing I was saying. Despite my repeated requests, he refused to transfer me to someone who spoke English. Finally, I told him to have a supervisor who speaks English call me or send me in writing any further requests for information that they needed. He hung up. 

When no one contacted me by phone or letter or asked for any supporting documentation in the next 3 weeks, concerned, I checked online. Citibank had failed to put in dispute a single one of the charges I had spoken to two fraud specialists about ( and had cancelled my card because of ). 

I then spent an entire day submitting my dispute online on XX/XX/2021. I told Citi in the disputes online that I was mailing all of the supporting documentation to show fraud. Instead of doing any investigation, 3 days after I submitted the dispute and before they could have even received my documentation, they falsely stated that I had failed to respond to their ( non-existent ) request for information. 

I have copies of everything. This is where I sent the documentation : Fraud Investigations/ Dispute Resolution Citibank XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX KY XXXX I provided them with a complete list of all fraudulent charges, all of which were easily traceable to other people ( train tickets even had names on them and all the furniture and XXXX charges had to be delivered somewhere ). I also attached the official XXXX XXXX of all of my account charges for the relevant time period so that they could see valid charges vs fraudulent, e.g. not charges made from my account. I provided a sworn attestation and agreed to fully cooperate in their investigation. 

It is unbelievable that they did no investigation at all. I will be closing all of my accounts with them and switching to a different bank card. This company 's willful disregard of teh law or gross incompetence is outrageous. I have never had this problem with XXXX or XXXX."

IN ADDITION, XXXX POLICE REPORT/COMPLAINT # : XXXX was filed XX/XX/21. 
Citibank , N.A . failed to safeguard my funds in my Savings Plus account. My account was hacked on XX/XX/21 ( probably on XX/XX/21 ) as I was able to see the unauthorized ACH debit posted to an unknown account/person ( XXXX ) in the amount of {$19000.00}. 
I was shocked and immediately tried to report the fraud to Citibank and was sent to XXXX representative XXXX ID # : XXXX and explained what I saw and asked to report this as fraud/hacking. After several transfers and was unable to hear clearly I asked for a US representative in the Fraud department. I was told these funds were completely gone and the ACH transferred without any red flag alert, security check or confirmation that this large transfer was never my habit in 39 years of banking with Citibank. They did not transfer money in increments, but in less than overnight-they fully completed this fraudulent transaction. I was asked if I wanted to dispute and then assigned CASE ID # : XXXX. 
It has been my clear pattern and habit to transfer any funds from savings into checking before executing an ACH Debit. They said all that was needed to execute this fraud was my name, routing number and account number. This was very alarming, but they did not seem to want to expedite this matter until I asked to speak to a supervisor. Supervisor XXXX ID # : XXXX then expedited this to Citibank 's PECS Department which is internal, back office and I am not able to contact them directly. I have still not been given provisional credit or return of my funds and they only will say their investigation is "" ongoing '' while I can not use my funds which I need now very much."

I had 2 people who made offers to buy the property for a percentage but, the bank refused saying that it was not enough. one offer was for {$18000.00} and the other was for {$30000.00}. Agents told me that many people didn't put in offers because the garage that is located near the property did not come with the house. So with no acceptable offers, the property went into foreclosure and in XX/XX/XXXX it was sold for {$24000.00}. The mortgage never included the garage located near the property but, as of XX/XX/XXXX, there was a survey completed showing that the garage is actually part of the property. The garage was never insured and only used 1 stall of the garage being that the other stall was used by the owner of other property, and believed to be owned by the owner of other nearby property that shares driveway next to the property. The power is connected to the other property. The garage was never included on the mortgage or appraisal for the mortgage. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX did not work with me or provide accurate information regarding workout options which have resulted in foreclosure on my credit report and preventing me from getting another home for me and my family."
2021-02-08,Mortgage,"We just refinanced with amerisave. They lost my first payment. I had to keep calling to see if they could find it, they never did. Finally on the last day before the payment would be late, I had to pay over the phone. Then I had to go to my bank and cancel the check. For my second payment I didnt get the bill until the day before it was due. I sent the check in right away and they still havent cashed it yet. I have made numerous calls to the company without a reasonable solution. They asked that I submit payments online, but when I tried to sign up for the online portal- the program could not locate my account information. The person whom I called about it said they would fix it and get back to me but no one ever did. I am very unhappy with this company and am nervous about my payments not being processed accurately."

I was told by my agent to file a claim with the credit card company for a refund due to NOT receiving the services I paid for. I filed a claim by phone on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I received notification that the claim was denied and closed. 

I went inside the bank this time on XX/XX/XXXX, to file another claim. I spoke to an associate who had to file the claim by phone. She explained to the person that I had not received the services for which I paid for and explained to them the business was in financial default under receivership ( State of Wisconsin ). The person told the associate the issue was between me and the merchant. She then reiterated that the business was in financial default. The claims person said they were not responsible for the Government shut down and refunding me the money. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I attempted to file a claim online with Wells Fargo. I can not do so because the online banking is not showing the transactions for those purchases. It shows all my other purchases, but not those mentioned above. I do have them on my XX/XX/XXXX bank statement.

In addition to catching them rack fees in my account and being issued a refund for multiple instances of these fee assessments, I believe Wells Fargo is a predatory bank that should be investigated. 

They are resolving themselves of their place in the student debt crisis and selling their student loan accounts to a third party -- leaving thousands of us with loans nearly in default to instead deal with collection agencies where additional fees will be added. 

This is unfair, inaccurate, and it should be examined further to prevent Wells Fargo from further profiting from it's predation."

Details : LoanCare is my mortgage service provider. My loan was sold to them as, clearly, no sane person would choose to do business with LoanCare. My residence 's property taxes are due in XXXX, and we refinanced and closed this LoanCare loan on XX/XX/XXXX. The closing attorney for our new loan paid the property taxes in early XX/XX/XXXX, and then LoanCare *also* paid the property taxes. I have confirmed with the XXXX XXXX XXXX for XXXX XXXX, South Carolina that the closing attorneys payment was received first. Therefore, when the XXXX XXXX XXXX received the LoanCare payment from our escrow account, they sent a refund check to LoanCare on XX/XX/XXXX. 

That property tax refund belongs to us. Until LoanCare refunds us, we have essentially paid property taxes twice : once through the closing on the refinance and once through a full year 's worth of escrow that LoanCare collected with our monthly payments. Anyone can contact the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for XXXX XXXX to verify this. 

LoanCare 's website agrees that our mortgage with them is paid-off as of XX/XX/XXXX. Unfortunately, they are not showing the negative {$3800.00}. Even though they recognize that we don't owe them anything else, and our relationship should be over, they have not refunded the doubly-paid property taxes of {$3800.00}.

As you can see in the attached Experian report the balance changed almost monthly for no apparent reason or without any clear itemization. 

Finally, XXXX claimed that the roughly {$390.00} was for personal property tax. Since the State of VA prorates I ask XXXX to send me a statement of the tax record. They didn't send anything other than non-informational monthly statements. recently my credit score took a big hit 100+ points.

I ask XXXX to update the credit bureaus with the status of the account has been paid in full. XXXX agrees it's been paid in full but refuses to report this to the bureaus or have the {$2800.00} charge off.

I called XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX after seeing that my credit report was updated with delinquent payments. I explained that I had not received a credit statement yet was reported delinquent. The rep proceeded to look into my account. She asked for my email address. I gave it. She then noticed they had the wrong email address. They spelled my name wrong in the email address. 

I have never had a late payment before or after this incident on this card. 

So, I then made a large payment covering half of my current balance and requested that the email address be corrected and that they remove the late payments on my credit. I was promptly sent a letter roughly one week later from XXXX XXXX saying they reporterd correctly and will not be removing the late payments. 

This is very shady business practices. It was clearly a clerical error on their part, which in turn prevented me from even being able to access my account information ( because my email address couldn't be used to set a password since the email was incorrect ). 

I had a near stellar payment history until this occurred. I am disgusted with XXXX XXXX 's lack of responsibility, which clearly occurred due to their representative lacking English language skills. Not speaking English is fine, but screwing up the spelling of a customer 's account information and then holding them accountable because you can't understand them is not acceptable. If I would have received my statements, the bill would have been paid on time, no questions asked."

It is at this time that I will point out the in Cushman v TransUnion, Stevenson v. TRW ( Experian ), and Richardson v.

Sending out a generic form through the e-Oscar system that doesnt even contain my reasons for the dispute is not reasonable. 

If you dont initiate an investigation regarding my dispute, as it is my right under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, I will have to take legal action to protect my credit rating and myself.

When I contacted them to correct this error in their reporting, they refused to correct it. 

According to Section 3513 ( d ) of the CARES Act ( Public Law 116-136 ), federal student loan repayment suspensions were supposed to be reported to consumer reporting agencies positively ( i.e., as if the borrower has been making regular payments. In relevant part subsection ( d ) reads : During the period in which the Secretary suspends payments on a loan under subsection ( a ), the Secretary shall ensure that, for the purpose of reporting information about the loan to a consumer reporting agency, any payment that has been suspended is treated as if it were a regularly scheduled payment made by a borrower. 

CARES Act suspension of federal student loan repayment was extended until XX/XX/2021.

In accordance of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) : 605. Requirements relating to information contained in consumer reports [ 15 U.S.C. 1681c ] ( a ) Information exclu
ded from consumer reports. Except as authorized under subsection ( b ) of this section, no consumer reporting agency may make any consumer report containing any of the following items of information : ( 1 ) Cases under title 11 [ United States Code ] or under the Bankruptcy Act that, from the date of entry of the order for relief or the date of adjudication, as the case may be, antedate the report by more than 10 years.

604. Permissible purposes of consumer reports [ 15 U.S.C. 1681b ] ( a ) In general. Subject to subsection ( c ), any consumer reporting agency may furnish a consumer report under the following circumstances and no other : ( 1 ) In response to the order of a court having jurisdiction to issue such an order, or a subpoena issued in connection with proceedings before a Federal grand jury.

( 2 ) In accordance with the written instructions of the consumer to whom it relates.

With subsections 604 and 605, the credit reporting agencies did not get the information of my bankruptcy from the State of Tennessee nor did I express that information to be made public in any expressed written agreement or statement. The three credit reporting agencies received my personal credit information from public records which they are not in compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act.

Fair Credit Reporting Act states the regulation and laws that govern the three credit reporting agencies, however the misuse of personal information for financial gain harms consumers. I could not find a place to stay because that was on my credit report and reduce my score.

2021-02-04,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I have contacted Experian a total of three times to dispute inaccurate reporting on my credit report by my student loan servicer. 

The dates I have contacted Experian to file a dispute are : XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. 

The disputes in XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX were initiated by me through the Experian XXXX app. The XX/XX/XXXX dispute was taken over the phone by a dispute specialist. 

Each of the three disputes have consistently presented the same narrative : my account is being reported as 90 days late during a period of Income Based Repayment with a payment amount of {$0.00} due. 

I have submitted statements to Experian as part of the XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX disputes which reflect that no payment was due during the alleged 90-day delinquency in XX/XX/XXXX. 

I was unable to upload new evidence to the Experian consumer upload site because the files were too big on the first attempt. This caused the website to display an error message on further attempted uploads and also for any other sessions. 

The results from all of my disputes return with no change being made. The reason is because my student loan servicer has certified to Experian that the information is correct and as a result would remain. 

This is a boilerplate response and I do not feel that individual human attention has been given to my dispute. If that were the case, Experian could clearly see that it is not possible for my student loan account to be delinquent when no payment has been due multiple years prior to and after XX/XX/XXXX. 


I am aware of my rights if I disagree with the results. However, the remedies that are listed on my report are not available. I can not submit a statement of disagreement to be listed on my report nor have I been able to obtain the method and details of how the investigation was conducted. 

This is the ONLY delinquency on my report and as a result, my score and credit file are suffering. This impedes my ability to obtain credit which is causing me to suffer a loss. 

Experian should stop acting in favor of the student loan servicer and instead conduct investigation in a neutral format as they are legally obligated to do."

I believe Experian has purposely made it hard so that consumers are forced to subscribe to their paid subscription to lock credit. I am sure they are violating some consent decree by making it impossible to freeze my credit report online..

All documentation required was submitted to a loan that were pre-approved before we initialize the purchase process. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, and because the appraisal was received for a lower market value amount of the original Purchase Price, we agree with the seller and submitted an amendment to the Purchase Option Contract to reflect a new Purchase Price. After that change we did not receive a new Loan Estimate from the loan originator. 

The process continue and after all updates and documentation provided we received a call from the loan originator officer on XX/XX/XXXX that the loan was approved by the investor at 90 %, as primary residence, but the PMI insurance rejected the coverage due to the condominium can not be insured as primary residence. They give us the alternative and sent new Loan Estimates with loans at 80 % which represent a significant larger amount from us and differences in the closing costs from the original one.

I think is important to add, that from the beginning we made clear that we were not interested in a 80 % loan, so was for us a surprise that at the end of the process they are saying that we have approved a loan that can't be close and feel that we were tricked in the process. We rejected the new loans offer and we are losing the opportunity to buy the apartment. After the rejection of the new loans we had not received comments from the Mortgage Originator."

I was told a "" release of debt letter '' would be sent. 

The XXXX agent omitted the fact that the letter would not include the language I had requested and did not indicate that, as I was told later on, no "" pay for delete '' would be possible. 

I believe that they were deceitful in their attempts to obtain payment and lied by omission. 

Further, XXXX confirmed this was sent to straight to collections. I was not given an opportunity to make good on my debt. I still have an account with XXXX for Internet services. No billing indicated I was delinquent and service was never cutoff. Further, they have record of our transfer service request with our new service address.

All of my accounts with US Bank is, and has been in excellent standings prior to this teller encounters which is why I believe was an act of retaliation and discrimination on that date and a person like her should not be in the banking profession mishandling Federal currencies any way she feels when she get upset with a customer. This 11 day hold is unreasonable and unprofessional when my checks always is 2-4 days ( at least from XXXXXXXX XXXX of a hold.

In our situation this was not the case but at the time I trusted my lender and mortgage loan officer, XXXX XXXX was doing right by me and was doing everything by law, I see now that is not the case.

2021-02-02,Vehicle loan or lease,"My Problem is with KIA Motor Finance. I am emailed before each payment is taken out of my checking account. The XXXX payment was about {$45.00} more than the contract stated payment of {$380.00} per month. Then after I called them no one could tell me why on my first six conversations, so I informed my bank to not allow the payment be taken out of my checking account. Then I followed up even before the payment was due and spent another 3 hours on the phone trying to find out why the payment was higher and finally after six more conversations they told me that due the the change of state ( I bought the car in South Carolina and then had it retitled in Florida ) the sales tax amount changed and so does my payment. I said by over {$40.00}! So by now I just wanted to know what my payment would be and they could not give me a straight answer because they had put a {$15.00} NSF penalty due to my stop payment through my bank. Now they have given my a payment amount of {$400.00} but they want to charge me {$7.00} to take a payment over the phone and if I don't pay by XXXX XXXX, 2021 I will not only owe the NSF {$15.00} but also a {$15.00} late fee. This is driving me crazy. I am a XXXX year old senior living on a fixed income and just wanted to know what my payment was. Then I found out that because the state where I bought the car ( South Carolina ) charges the entire sales tax up front and Florida charges month by month that I have to go back to South Carolina tax authority to get a refund and that is not right either. What should I do? I have not made my payment as of XXXX XXXX, 2021. Thanks"

That complaint was resolved by XX/XX/XXXX, when my mortgage lender closed the escrow account and reversed the payments that it had improperly debited from my mortgage payments to credit to the invalid escrow account. 

I recently received my form 1098 Mortgage Interest Statement for the XXXX tax year from my mortgage lender. On previous statements from previous tax years, Box 10 has been empty. On the statement for the XXXX tax year, Box 10 contains an amount -- {$810.00}. This amount is the same figure that factored into the escrow error that my lender made last year. 

I contacted my lender twice today ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and spoke to two separate customer service representatives to discuss the amount listed in Box 10 of the document, and to request a corrected XXXX Mortgage Interest Statement if the {$810.00} negatively impacts my tax filing. Neither representative seemed to fully understand the potential problems that this {$810.00} figure can cause and both stated that issuance of a corrected 1098 Mortgage Statements is not possible. Yet, the document itself clearly contains a box that the lender is required to check if a corrected document is issued and there is also verbiage on the back of the document informing the mortgagee how to proceed in the event that an error is identified. Neither representative knew how to assist me. 

My tax preparer stated that the {$810.00} figure that currently appears in Box 10 will reduce any tax refund that I may receive unless the XXXX statement is corrected. She also stated that this information on the form has been reported to IRS, so it must be corrected by the lender if it is incorrect.

It took forever to get hold of someone at PHH Mortgage Services and they were not very helpful.

2021-02-04,Mortgage,"Thank you in advance for your attention in resolving unfair practices with Selected Portfolio Servicing. As of today XX/XX/2021, I have been denied a forbearance or a reasonable loan modification. SPS is not being helpful during the Covid 19 crisis. I asked for a forbearance and instead they offered a modification with a 3 month trial period. Not knowing what they were going to come back with till after a 3 month trial period. I was shocked to see the unreasonable & unheard proposed terms. It sounds like a major rip off. They have to stop ripping us off. I used to work in mortgage lending and currently a Notary Signing Agent and I do not see these types of terms they want us to agree to! 

This is a second loan. 
6 months unpaid mortgage payments equal to a total of {$3500.00} with fees which I still need to review but it is less then $ XXXX. XXXX Months of XXXX ) Modification trial periodXXXX Paid {$360.00} each month and on XXXXas well. 

Proposed Modification received XX/XX/2021 New payment {$360.00} which may adjust. 
New Maturity date XXXX, will add 14 years. Current Maturity date XXXX. 
Final ballon payment on the interest bearing principal balance of {$34000.00} is due on the XXXX Date. Yes XXXX XXXX, XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
Amortization Term XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX. Basically 40 years. 

We owe less than $ 5k and they want to charge over $ 50k. Includes the ballon payment and the difference in the new maturity date. Sounds like a rip off to me! 

We have no problem keeping the same monthly amount of {$580.00} & extending the term by 6 months or even 1 year like we did with our 1st mortgage with no problem. If they want to call it a Forbearance or a Modification it's ok. What's not ok, they tell us it is their investors choice. They don't disclose who the investor is and we have the right to know this as well. 

Hope you are able to help us and other upcoming customers with the same issue. I have been reading reviews on Yelp and XXXX  and they are being referred to CFPB. Thank you for your assistance.

Their reporting of the collection, even though incorrect and removed, thus affected my credit score adversely, jeopardizing my ability to secure a home loan. As a single mother, this affects not only myself, but my children. Nothing else changed on my credit report-no hard pulls on my credit, no cards opened, no delinquencies, and my score was not affected with the other two reporting agencies. This was solely an Experian response to a credit inquiry."

I did not get a response or results. So I sent another letter XX/XX/XXXX and the credit bureaus still havent responded. From my knowledge the credit bureaus have 30 days to complete an investigation or the accounts must be deleted according to Section 611 ( a ). So now these accounts need to be deleted immediately or I just might file litigation because this is becoming super stressful and the credit bureaus have been ignoring me on purpose. I am also a victim of the XXXX  data breach so XXXX knows who have gotten my information.

2021-02-03,Credit card or prepaid card,"Synchrony Bank closed an account of mine without any prior notification, and have negatively affected my credit. 

I have several relationships with Synchrony Bank, and have been a customer for over 10 years. I got a notification this morning from XXXX XXXX that one of my account was closed. In checking, I noticed Synchrony had closed my XXXX XXXX line of credit because it's been 3 years since I used the account. Why I am filing a complaint is because they closed this account without any prior written or verbal communication to me in that regard. When I contacted them, they informed me they would not be able to open the account again, and if I wanted a new account I would have to apply. I've had this account open for 7 years, and have never missed a payment. They just recently even increased my limit. It isn't typical that car tires are replaced but every 4 years. By them closing the account it has affected my average age of credit and lowered my credit score. If I apply for a new account, it will only further lower my credit score, this was a horrible experience, and it's extremely unprofessional. If it was a matter of me using the card then you should have sent me a notice, and I would have happily used the card to keep the account active."

At the same time I asked for the account to be closed. The agent promised me that the account was going to be closed. To my surprise, the account was not closed and they charged me service fees for the month of XXXX and XX/XX/2020 again and a late fee in the amount of {$29.00} in XX/XX/2020. Once, I found out about it I called them back to have this fees once again waived. They waived the fees again. The total amount was about {$58.00}. At that time I asked for the account to be closed again. They gave me a hard time. Before, this drama I had previously tried to close the account but they agent insisted to leave it open for emergencies and all service fees will be waived. Obviously, this did not occurred. All of these conversations should be recorded. They need to review the call logs to see that they were the ones making errors on the way the train their agents.

2021-02-05,Debt collection,"I had a XXXX XXXX account for over 25 years and the final bill contained late fees that were charged erroneously. I received a collection notice which is attached to this complaint from Sequium Asset Solutions. The notice provided 30 days from receipt of the notice to dispute the item contained in the notice. 

I was not given the benefit of the full 30 days of the notice to dispute this debt, and Sequium reported the debt to XXXX  and likely other bureaus, on XX/XX/2021, just 20 days inside of the 30 allowed by law. This debt was already paid in full via electronic check and still remains on my credit file with XXXX. 

Due to the fact that I was not given the proper 30 days from receipt of the notice dated XX/XX/2021 to dispute the debt which was already paid, I was treated unfairly for not allowing me the proper time to dispute the debt, a full 30 days, which Sequium reported prematurely."

I do not feel that I was ever a full 30 days late on any of my accounts and my personal records do not indicate this either.

2021-02-10,Debt collection,"I was contacted XX/XX/XXXX by an attorney working on behalf of Military Credit Services stating that I had a judgement entered against me in XXXX in XXXX, Virginia. Upon research appears this was common practice of Military Credit Services ( aka Freedom Stores ) that affected members of the military. During the time of the loan in question I was stationed at XXXX XXXX, NC. Though I have no recollection of visiting these stores, it is entirely possible that I purchased something from such a location. 

The attorney went further to explain they would not enforce a garnishment but would proceed to put a lien on my home if I failed to pay. He also informed me of an interest rate of 19.96 % having been entered during the judgement and relayed that over {$2000.00} had accumulated in the nearly 10 years of this judgement being entered. This account had went from around {$1300.00} to about {$3300.00} in the time since judgement. I had never been served during this time period and was unaware of such activity taking place without my right to dispute or appear in court. 

From subsequent research I was able to find that many of these claims were set aside or refunded, as they showed lack of proper process in notification. This issue has apparently eluded XXXX and XXXX XXXX ( the attorney that has reinstated the adverse credit items on my report and contacted me for collection )."

During this recorded line, I let them know what was my last transaction and all the fraud one. They made two cases - one for the ATM charges and the other for actual credit charges. At the same time I had to contact XXXX and try to get a new phone. I received a letter stating that both fraud charges were denied and contacted SUNTRUST to find out why. They refused to give us information and stated that we could only do an appeal. They sent us the form needed and I filled it out. In the appeal, I showed proof of requesting new phones, money transfers that my wife sent to my friends since I had no way of getting cash since my bank account was emptied. After 45 days - where we called several times and were told that no information could be given - we received a second denial. There was no explanation, no documentation of the investigation to back up the decision. We recorded this phone call because of all the false information the bank kept giving us. We were finally sent to a supervisor who stated that there was nothing else we can do. After an appeal is denied there is no futher procedure to fight for injustice. There is no proof of the investigation and the supervisor could not give us a reason for the denial. We recorded the supervisor informing us the the decision is given to a specialist and once they decide SUNTRUST will not do anything else. My identity was stolen, my bank account was emptied ( over {$1000.00} ) - my bank history shows I have never taken out more than XXXX cash ever at one time - EVER since I opened the account but they refused to find 5 transactions of XXXX at an atm unsuspicious!

Being a dentist, I had no source of income for months ( 6 ) last yr, due to covid mandatory shutdown. 
but XXXX XXXX kept calling, emailing me for monthly dues.all credit card cos were required to offer a deferral programme.but this is the only credit card, that did not even have a deferral programme. they only waived late fees for 2 months, and kept charging me even late fees?? 
I talked to them couple of times, once the agent said, its ok if I cant pay, they will stop the collection for a period of time. But they never did that, only kept adding late fees, and sending me monthly bills, month after month.shockingly, they were mean enough to call me all the time, even on my home phone, and disturb sleep of seniors at home! 
Due to their lack of total sensitivity, I stopped even trying to talk to them.whereas, all other credit cards cos, have been humane, and offered my deferment plans.and I am paying them all on time now. 
I do know, that all credit cards cos were supposed to offer deferment plans, to those effected by lockdown, and total loss of income.but, XXXX XXXX had no such plan?? 
I am also head of household, so any effect on my credit score adversely effects the whole family.its not even my fault. 
my office was closed again since XXXX XXXX, due to very high covid cases in this county. 
i am trying to take baby steps to re-open, but not much business.it will take few months to even get business back to where i can afford to pay essential bills. 
dont forget, i have to file taxes too. 
all the late fees added so many times ( aleast 6 times ) need to be removed. 
i can only think of paying sometime next yr, in 2022, not this yr. 
Finally, XXXX XXXX was quick to transfer my acc to a collection agency.i just can not can not afford to pay this years sir. Have soo many urgent bills like electricity, food, gas, rent,,, to pay first. 
I have seniors at home too. 
I have no choice to file a complaint about this ongoing harassment.

I kept getting transferred to the fraud department back to the costumer service department to the investigation department. At one point in XXXX the investigative department said they would look into it but was never assigned to anyone. This entire time I kept making the statement that i did not want this to affect my credit score. They said they were making corrections. My credit score was negatively impacted and my credit limit was dropped from XXXX to XXXX. I called last week and the week before each time with the person on the only line stating to give it 7 -10 business days to get resolved. At this point I feel like I am being harassed and taken advantage of. At one point i was getting daily calls from a Robo call to pay the bill. I hope that all my calls have been recorded as proof of what I am being put through. My credit score has been negatively affected and I am now having to wait to start my refinance due to the hit on my credit score. I have been treated poorly as I would have expected that by this point I would have been assigned 1 agent to take care of these issues for me.

XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX A spokesman said All banks have responsibilities under federal law to cooperate with law enforcement inquiries in full compliance with the law. 

Is this accurate? I thought the RFPA was designed to prevent this very thing. The act was intended to prevent government overreach of consumer financial records. Obviously some of that changed with Patriot Act ( which is unfortunate ) but that has since expired.

Did Bank of America do this? 

Was Bank of America provided court orders to release individuals information? 

Why do they think this doesn't violate Fourth Amendment or RFPA?

I also asked about my year end statement fot tax purposes and was told that the "" only obligation they had was to provide that statement by XXXX. I did not receive that statement until XX/XX/XXXX. Freedom Mortgage has been a horrible company to deal with and should never be allowed to handle VA mortgages.

I've had this mortgage with them for over 10 years and have always been on time with my payments. 
So, I don't understand they will not disburse me the ooverage escrow funds. The funds were in escrow, but they are acting like my account is delinquent, which it is not. 
This is not right to treat a senior citizen this way. Please review my account and disburse me my money.

2021-02-04,Credit card or prepaid card,"1. I am not receiving interest charged by XXXX XXXX  master card from merchant-initiated refunds in the amounts of {$100.00} and {$490.00}. ( explanations for refunds explained in complaint ) 2. My second concern is that my interest remains the same albeit that I am paying double the monthly payment! 
Both above listed refunds were refunded due to charge errors to my credit card from merchants. I reached out to XXXX XXXX  XX/XX/XXXX and was informed that I was not entitled to an "" interest refund '' whether the refund was from a charge or return error. I made a complaint against this company XX/XX/XXXX due to its failure to recover funds from an illegal and unauthorized transaction. For this reason, I decided to work with XXXX and XXXX to recover funds that were posted to my account in error. XXXX account has two cards on file and the debit card that I used did not go through because the system used my delivery addresss zip code. I caught it immediately and corrected the error with the agent but not until the system charged the XXXX  XXXX  credit card thus, I had to wait for a refund. XXXX  XXXX  did not have authorization to charge my card and it took me to make a complaint with XXXX XXXX to get my funds back! 

My second concern is that my interest charges do not seem to change. I inquired about my interests amount and was given a rate 3.35 % ; Variable 21.99 % and XXXX I guess it means APR. I asked the agent several times to slow down and explain what was going on, uncertain if she knew. I inquired again if I could have my interest rate lowered and was told there were no promotions at this time. I went on to question How can the company feign to provide COVID-19 relief payment assistance and not offer the means to lower interest rates for the customer to continue to make payments? It appears to be ALL A RUSE! 

Attached you will see that the interest rates charged monthly do not change. On my XX/XX/XXXX statement the available credit was listed as {$570.00} and the payment due was {$170.00}. XX/XX/XXXX reflects a credit in the amount of {$490.00}, INCREASING THE AVAILABLE CREDIT TO {$1000.00} and yet the payment amount does not change! You can also see this in the increased payment amounts ( agent will excuse the cut and paste attachment for this card company has not provided online earlier statements for several years ) for example a payment of {$450.00} posted on XX/XX/XXXX reflected an interest difference from a {$200.00} made the prior month of {$0.00}! 
I have been with this company since the early XXXX and the number amount of monies applied have always affected the payment amount due to change from either higher to lower! It is as if no one is monitoring the system!"

2021-02-09,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I called Experian about an account dispute. Today i received a message from Experian stating an account dispute had been opened. I logged into my account to review this information because i did not dispute any account this day. Experian would not tell me where this account originated from. All they could tell me was it was Medical. I dont owe any because any Medical treatment i ever recd is approved by my insurer to be paid in full. I had previously disputed this account several months ago and Experian removed the account since they did not verify the account within 30 days. Now this same account was able to open a dispute then put the account back on my credit report for this absurd amount. Experian could not tell me information how this investigation was done despite the email stating i could request investigation information ( see attached ). Heck they couldn't tell me anything. Please help me because this is wrong. Im sick of these scams taken advantage of people. 
Amount is {$1900.00}. 
Company is XXXX This amount is Nowhere to be found in any past billing for any facility! 
It's pretty sad that Experian, the credit keeper just allows this activity without proof. They said the collection co sent an affidavit and that was good enough for them. i asked Experian to please forward that to me and they told me No they didn't have to. 
This is pathetic how we are treated. 
And i just want to add how unreasonable and abusive Experian was to me on the phone. "" I was told, "" You can call us so why don't you call them '' really Experian! Why on earth would i call a scammer who just wants to scam me more. Her name was XXXX and the man i spoke with prior was worse. He basically told me to be quiet and let him finish talking. Uhm, if i need to interject regarding my personal credit report i will. He would not allow me to speak with a manager when i asked for management. Just unbelievable all around."

After a few days we received an email from Wells Fargo from XXXX requesting that fill out a form to request the information we needed. We did so on Monday, XXXX XXXX. We have not gotten any response from anyone and can not find anyone to speak with us about this matter. Anyone we speak to wants to pass us off to someone else. We tried dealing with a local branch and were told they could not help with this matter and we would need to talk to someone in commercial banking."
2021-02-09,Debt collection,"In XX/XX/2020, I was moving and tried to change my XXXX XXXX internet to my new address. XXXX told me they served my new address, but when I plugged in the equipment and it didn't work, I called them and they admitted they do not serve my new address. I immediately cancelled my account and returned my equipment on XX/XX/XXXX. 

A few weeks later I got a notice that I had a bill due on the cancelled account. I called XXXX and they informed me the bill was an error and my account had XXXX balance. I confirmed this in their online portal ( using my existing account info ). They also told me to ignore any additional statements sent in the next few weeks. Then, on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a collections notice ( reference # XXXX ) from Sequium Asset Solutions for a {$49.00} XXXX  bill on an account number I had never seen before. 

I logged into XXXX and only my old account -- not this account -- showed up, and it told me I had {$0.00} balance. I called XXXX  and discovered that they had, without telling me, created a new account at the address they had never provided Internet access for and transferred a charge they had never informed me about to my new account. I made repeated attempts to log in to the new account to verify the balance but was unable to do so -- it kept showing {$0.00} balance on the old account. 

Finally, on XX/XX/XXXX, I was able to reach someone at XXXX  who allowed me to pay the balance on the new account over the phone. ( I still don't know if this charge was legit or where it came from, but at this point I just wanted to be done with the whole thing so I paid it. ) I am alarmed that they sent the bill to collections while I was actively trying to figure out whether it was legit, and that they transferred it to an account that they never told me about ( therefore making it impossible for me to pay ), and that they told me repeatedly that I had already paid my outstanding balance. I am concerned about the impact this could have on my credit score when it's all a result of really, really bad customer service on XXXX XXXX part."

Then a Customer Service Person told me via the phone that our terms, interest rate and monthly payments changed, This is a fixed rate and it is a standard fixed loan. We wanted a longer term of the loan and payment assistant of which we never got!. To the date of this complaint Wells Fargo without any knowledge sold our Private Loan Student to XXXX XXXX, I only found this out because a notice was on our on line banking. 
No help, our payments keep going up with interest charged daily.

Wells Fargo is not helping in any way and I keep calling I called their Student Loan Department XXXX I have several complaints with the Home Office and still no one is helping us!

2021-02-09,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","In XX/XX/XXXX I contacted Experian to correct a negative payment history on a credit card with XXXX XXXX from XX/XX/XXXX. I provided the following information. 

In XXXX XXXX XXXX I was deployed when all communication was secured for operational security. We were without internet access for approximately 40 days. During this time, the credit card payment was due, but I was unable to make the payment without internet access. As soon as access was restored, I promptly paid the bill in its entirety. 

Experian closed the investigation today. They added the addition to the comment section : "" and dispute investigation completed, consumer disagrees. '' The comment could be construed that an investigation was actually conducted, which seems doubtful, and I disagreed with the results of the investigation. To my knowledge I have not been provided with any further information collected during the investigation such as a response from XXXX XXXX. Dispute and disagree are synonymous, so not only could the comment be misconstrued, but it would seem that the entirety of the investigation was to add a comment documenting that I disagreed or disputed something, which required no investigation at all because the "" investigation '' was a direct consequence of filing a dispute with the report. 

If Experian or XXXX XXXX had provided documentation or rational to the justification for the negative mark on my credit score, I would have been receptive to concluding this matter ; however, this resolution was recursive and evidences the insincere at best or false claim that Experian actually investigated the matter. If an investigation did not take place, they have willfully neglected their responsibility to investigate this dispute."

When I received my statement I noticed that we were still charged for the fraudulent charges despite reporting that they were not authorized.

Dear Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, I just found out that Citibank has reduced their next day Inter Institutional Transfers to ones External Accounts have been lowered from XXXX  to XXXX} until further notice. That is a XXXX XXXX REDUCTION! This just happened recently and I believe it is due to the whole XXXX shorting saga. What this policy can do is put the individual investor behind the 8-ball because they may need to move their money into their brokerage accounts to cover their trades. Citibanks standard service takes 3-5 days that is longer than the 2-day settlement date one is given to settle their stock trades. I also ask you, What good is being able to transfer only XXXX  a day? 

These are the messages that is posted once you sign into your Citibank account : - Effective immediately, as a security measure to protect Citibank accounts, the limits for next day Inter Institutional Transfers to your External Accounts have been lowered to XXXX until further notice. You can continue using the standard service to transfer to your External Accounts for amounts greater than XXXX 


When taking to a Citibank representative, these were their responses : - We never intent to upset our customers however it is applied to secure the fraud transactions.. 

- It is to protect Citibank accounts from a heightened risk of fraud, I am sorry for any inconvenience this has caused to you - It was initially XXXX using next day service now it was lowered to XXXX whereas standard transfer is still same with limit of XXXX - As an enhanced security measure and to protect Citibank accounts from a heightened risk of fraud, the limits for next day Inter Institution Transfers were lowered. You are still able to send IIT 's with a higher amount using the standard service.

The bureaus are violating FDCPA section 807. They have also failed to respond or investigate my disputes within a timely manner. This behavior is completely unacceptable. It is restricting my family and I from living our life comfortably.
2021-02-05,Mortgage,"When I bought my house in XXXX, I got 2 mortgages. One was a conventional primary and I do not have any problem with it. The problem arouse from Specialized Loan Servicing LLC. Originally I got second mortgage from XXXX. In XX/XX/XXXX they charged off my second mortgage. But from the beginning of XXXX I started receiving letters from Specialized Loan Servicing LLC where they claimed I owe them money. I told them XXXX written off my second mortgage and it was reflected in my credit history but still they said NO, they bought my debt and I owe them money now. I asked them to send me proof which they refusing. After they keep on sending me bills. A few times I offered them some amounts of what I was able to at the time in hope of settling my account to which they always refused and the interest kept on increasing ridiculously. I could not afford to pay them by what I found strange is that my credit history was not affected, I did not see any late payments, any collection of second mortgage amount show up anywhere on my credit. In XX/XX/XXXX XXXX send me 1099-C form with amount of {$68000.00} ( interest only ), Box 6 - G ( which in description states they got agreement from my part, WHICH THEY DO NOT HAVE ). When I called them to ask whether the whole amount of mortgage with interest was written off they said - NO. They want a full payment of mortgage which in fact was less then the interest they accrued! Also, I asked them to send me any paperwork they said - Oh, you should have it already. But I did not received anything. I tired calling numerous number provided by them to ask for paperwork- no luck. 
Again I checked my credit history and there was not any debt collector SLS there. I guess they are trying to get money using scam method. Please help me to resolve this situation because they are not communicating with me except requesting money. 

Thank You."

XXXX of XXXX I traveled to Florida for vacation. In order check in my return flight I had to pay with a credit card. I used my XXXX card and paid {$120.00} dollars. When I received my Frontier Barclay Card statement in XX/XX/XXXX, that is when I saw that they auto charged my account for the same amount of {$120.00}. I called Barclay to dispute the charges, sent the statement for my credit card that I used to pay for check in. Called to follow up with Barclay and they said they never received the fax. So I sent it again, this continued for months- with sending the fax statements and being told that they never received the proof. Barclay also advised me to go dispute charges with the other credit card company and I refused that, because I personally paid with that card ( I was not going to dispute something that I paid for ). This continued, within that time I also paid off the balance with Barclay of over {$2000.00} minus the {$120.00} just to close the account and continue to dispute the charges. In XX/XX/XXXX, while this was still going on, I faxed again the statements and Barclay sent a letter to tell me that they received the statements but unfortunately it was past the dispute range and expired. As you can see that I was beyond frustrated- why would I pay a huge lump sum and leave {$120.00} on the account if I owed that. I still call about every 6 months, because now, they put me in collections for {$400.00} and yet I can't even settle that because it has been charged off and they have no way to apply a payment. This has gone way too far on the credit cards part and I feel that proof and faxes were intentionally disappearing or they were giving me the wrong fax number- to where the statements and proof just got dismissed, until they saw that the faxes and the dates of my dispute went out of the range. I would like for this case to be settled and off of my credit report, as it has not only been an emotional mess - when you would be able to see that I have an excellent history of paying bills and not debt with credit cards whatsoever. This whole situation has sabotaged me with lenders and prevented me being able to buy a house with the best credit score I can have if this was not on the report. Please consider reviewing and settling this account in any way to release what is not even my liability."

When I discovered this I immediately called my bank to see if they could halt or suspend the payment. They attemped to do so and were unable to. 

Both payments cleared by bank on XX/XX/2020 and were "" GOOD FUNDS ''.

XXXX XXXX suggested I call Loan Care and ask them to refund the 2nd over payment. I did so, and they told me to email a request to "" XXXX ''. I did that, and they replied stating that they needed a bank statement. At that time, I had not received the bank statement yet but sent them a 'screen shot '' of my bank portal showing the transaction clearing the bank. That apparently wasn't good enough. They replied with a closed "" ticket XXXX ''. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted XXXX XXXX and an agent and I together called Loan Care in an attempt to solve the issue. We were unable to get the issue resolved with the agent, and we asked to be transferred to a supervisor. XXXX XXXX both faxed and emailed documentation that Loan Care requested. 

With each question the XXXX XXXX representative and I asked, more obstacles were presented by the agent, couldn't be refunded to the bank, had to be sent by check, takes a minumum of 10 days, fax might not be found, delay delay, etc., etc. To say the process was frustrating was an understatement. 

The Supervisor eventually found the information XXXX XXXX sent and started a new "" ticket '' number XXXX. At the end of the call, however, we felt that the new ticket would be resolved. 

That was 2 and 1/2 weeks ago, and NO communication has come from Loan care. They have refused to return the overpayment. I notified them on the XXXX that if I did not have the refund by XX/XX/XXXX I would be contact the CFPB. That didn't phase them one little bit.

On Saturday, XX/XX/2021, I attempted to log into my account, and kept getting an error message that my password was incorrect ( which it was absolutely the correct password ). I then hit the "" forgot password '' to just reset the password, and received a message that online access to my account had been blocked and was prompted to call the customer service line. Over the course of the remainder of that afternoon, I called multiple times, each time either 1. being told that no information could be given to me or 2. being told completely different things every phone call. I was finally told that I would have to wait on a letter to be mailed to me to verify my account. 

It has been almost 2 weeks since I was first denied access to my account, and I have still received no letter in the mail. Each time I call, whether it's to gain access to my account or just attempt to close it and have the funds in my account mailed to me in a check, I am told that nothing can be done until I receive a letter, which is absolutely absurd. On my last phone call with citibank, which was today, the rep came back on the line and told me he simply could not help me, and that he would be terminating the call. He then hung up on me. My money is in this bank account, and i have no way of accessing it, nor closing my account, and Citibank refuses to assist me outside of mentioning a letter, that I have yet to receive after almost 2 weeks.

As of right now, I still have zero access to my account ( online banking ) or the money in it. I am being told to wait on a letter to arrive via USPS mail, that should have been here by now, and is still not here. We are in the middle of a pandemic, and I can not access my account nor can I close it."

They mentioned we would need to fill out documentation but to me it looked just like a traditional loan application and we were not told in the beginning that this would be a requirement to get the past amount moved to the end of the loan. 

I asked if we could have another extension that President Biden extended for all people who were effected by the Covid 19 and the rep mentioned they dont know anything about that and he just became President a few weeks ago. 

This is causing more stress on my husband and I we are elderly and we are trying to stay healthy and just want to pay our mortgage and have the balance that we owe put on the end.

( 2 ) In accordance with the written instructions of the consumer to whom it relates.

With subsections 604 and 605, the credit reporting agencies did not get the information of my bankruptcy from the State of Tennessee nor did I express that information to be made public in any expressed written agreement or statement.

This property is not a Condominium, it is a single family home which could be easily checked by using XXXX or perhaps just reading the documents. 

Even if this was a condo, what Condo owner pays the premium for the Master Insurance Policy for the Association? The only premium a Condo owner would pay is for an HO6 policy.

The rep then asked me if my policy covered walls in or just the outside. Again, this is a single family home so this question shows a poor understanding of what is in a Condo policy vs a single family home policy. 

The rep found that my paperwork was processed incorrectly designating it as a Condo. Why that happened and what possessed anyone to send a payment for a premium for a Master policy when you aren't even processing my payments yet for the mortgage is unbelievable. 

We are very disturbed that you would send funds out of our account when you do not even have the account till XX/XX/XXXX. 

I spoke with a rep for US Bank on XX/XX/XXXX and was assured my paperwork would be updated and the funds returned to my account. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received an email that US Bank has now sent another payment for homeowners insurance for {$1900.00} to XXXX XXXX. Still not our homeowners insurance policy.

The rep then stated he will submit a refund and within 90 days they will CONTACT THE MERCHANT and after contacting the merchant, they will then make a decision before closing the case. 

On XX/XX/XXXX of XXXX, BANK OF AMERICA reversed the refund which resulted my account being overdraft and they charge me an overdraft fee. ( {$69.00} was the refund ). I then received my stimulus check and because they took back the refund they gave me, my account was in the NEGATIVES and BANK OF AMERICA gave me a credit so My account will be positive again so I can get my full stimulus check. ( if they contacted the merchant and verified the merchant was already paid by my bf, then none of this would of happened ) the temporary credit was for {$43.00} which will end on XX/XX/XXXX ( all of this because no one reached out to the merchant and they caused my account to be in the negatives ) called Bank of America and was told, they NEVER CONTACTED the merchant because there was no urgency. I explained thats NOT what I was told and I was told they would reach out to the merchant before closing the case. 

I was advised that I would now have to submit my documents so they can reopen the case and that it would take up to 45 days I submitted the documents within one week of speaking to the agent. Then was told within 4 business days they would have a decision.

I called back within 5 business days and then was told 10 business days for a decision. I called back again and now was told 45 days again. ( Everyone keeps giving me new days of when this will be resolved ) Now XX/XX/XXXX is close and they will take back the credit of {$43.00} which will make my account go in the NEGATIVES again while they research the claim. For some reason no one can listen to all the calls I made where every agent in the claims department provided different information to me that contradicts what the last person said. And now Bank of America owes me {$69.00} and wants me to pay {$43.00} because of the overdraft fee they caused in my account.

On XX/XX/2020 when I made the first payment I asked the debt collector representative that was taking my payment that once I made the final payment would there be something sent to the creditors on my behalf to remove or delete as that was what I requested and they said yes once the final payment had been received. They also informed me that they will automatically mail me out a letter stating that it had been paid in full. Once I made the final payment on XXXX XXXX and I did not receive anything in mail after a week I called the debt collector and asked them why I had not received anything in mail and thats when they told me that I had toc all and request that.

To my surprise I did not get accurate information. Also, to have it removed or deleted the representative told me that it was something that was available upon request which I did request However, only to find out that this has not been removed or deleted from my credit. The last report showed that it was indeed paid in full but also as an active account which is not the truth. According to my research this is a UDAAP violation when there is Deceptive Acts of Practice which was very misleading for me and an very unnecessary process to do the things that I need to do."

Auto pay is set up to take the payment out on XXXX of each month to by the XXXX of the next month to always be on time. This is an electronic payment, not mail which might be lost! 

This is nothing short of harrassment to get another extra payment and I am NOT playing that game again! I never received the letter last time but paid that one regardless to be done with it since a corporation can produce anything they want to from a computer but an unsuspecting consumer can not prove they never received it! Refreshing your memory when I phoned the XXXX XXXX office to verify the XXXX due date, they said "" first payment due '' in XXXX is correct and proved my point.

These accounts and negative info is NOT in COMPLIANT with the laws and they need to be removed. Its impossible that you actually investigated these accounts because they are still reporting different dates of last active, different dates of last payment, different payment status and history, etc.

How come I disputed these accounts before, but the account status was never updated.?!? How come nothing legally was sent to me to verify the account?

XXXX still charged me for all the repairs. After several phone calls and multiple resubmissions of the documented receipts and pictures, XXXX finally removed most of the charges. I paid the lease termination fee of {$300.00} and a lost key for {$250.00} but XXXX continued to send me invoices each month. As you can see in the attached XXXX report the balance changed almost monthly for no apparent reason or without any clear itemization. 

Finally, XXXX claimed that the roughly {$390.00} was for personal property tax. Since the State of VA prorates I ask XXXX to send me a statement of the tax record. They didn't send anything other than non-informational monthly statements. recently my credit score took a big hit 100+ points. After investigating I found that XXXX had charged off {$2800.00} dollars. 

I have escalated this to a supervisor who claims there is nothing they can do, I ask the supervisor who would not provide his name or case/claim number. I ask for the supervisor I was speaking with for the 3rd time and he said "" she '' would call me. I have received no call. 

I ask XXXX to update the credit bureaus with the status of the account has been paid in full. XXXX agrees it's been paid in full but refuses to report this to the bureaus or have the {$2800.00} charge off. 

This was a 3-year lease. Not a single payment was ever late.

I spoke with XXXX, one of their Collections Analysts. After inquiring with respect to the stated account she affirmed that Americollect would immediately update the account with the credit Bureau as paid the same day before the close of business, if I opted for their 'Pay for Delete, which I did. Following XXXX 's guarantee that Americollect would update the account with the credit reporting agencies and expedite my request, I concurred to pay off the account in full, as agreed. It was brought to my attention that if I made the payment over the phone with her that I would not be able to be supplied a payment confirmation nor would it post the same day. Preceding this disclosure I elected to make the payment on their customer portal with the credentials she furnished for my account. I requested that XXXX stay on the line to ensure that the payment was processed successfully.

XXXX was instructed of the expectation, terms and arrangements coordinated and set in stone with XXXX on XXXX XX/XX/2021 at XXXX XXXX. She admonished me that the details which were provided to me were inaccurate. Being that they would not expedite anything to the Credit Bureaus, all payments made to Americollect whether online or over the phone are not processed until after 48 hours, and ultimately the payment posted date, in which I confirmed was received by Americollect after my payment. 

Succeeding this exchange with XXXX, I then requested to be placed with a Manager or Supervisor as a result of my dissatisfaction with my pledged expectations being unmet. Subsequent to my transfer I was connected to XXXX, Americollect Supervisor to express my great disenchantment and hurt. She went on to restate the particulars and details shared by XXXX.

Subsequently, I called Bank of America and after several hours I finally got to report the account as fraudulent and I was sent a Uniform ID Theft form to be filled out, signed, and returned with a copy of my ID ; which I did.

They are never going to see another dime from me, so they may as well give up. The money they're claiming I owe them is from disputes I had filed that they completely mishandled. Due to COVID-19 and the stores ' policies at the time, I could not help the fact that stores were not accepting returns for clothing, food, and anything sanitary-related ... I also could not help that restaurants I went to sucked and they could not get their orders straight, or that they gave me food that was horrible quality, etc. 

With many disputes I had filed, I showed supporting documentation of my claim, and they STILL denied my disputes, just because the merchants responded showing bill of sale! Zero of my disputes argued that I did not authorize the purchases. They all were filed under different categories. So basically, the merchants would respond to my dispute unaccordingly, completely dodging my reasons for disputing, and Citi would automatically find in favor of said merchant!! 

I'm glad they closed my account, because I was going to close it anyway as I refuse to do business with XXXX  ... The purpose of this complaint is for Citi to stop calling me. If they want me to pay off my so-called debt, then they can either transfer it to a collection agency or not. Either way, there is absolutely no reason to be calling me every XXXX day, every day for 8 months. And either way, they're not getting my money.

This is absolutely unacceptable. This has hurt our credit score and we feel that this is very wrong and we have NOT been protected from a very defective and deceptive purchase.
2021-02-03,Mortgage,"Specialized Loan Servicing purchased my equity line of credit XXXX {$60000.00} limit ) from XXXX XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX, The balance was in or around {$54000.00}. In XXXX XXXX XXXX or so XXXX the account reached its draw down limit {$60000.00}. I was not able to make but one payment in XXXX the rest of the payments were applied to the balance on the account. A bill collector on behalf of SLS contacted me in early XX/XX/XXXX about the account. I contacted SLS and sought a forbearance agreement. It was granted and they sent me a letter confirming that I was in forbearance for the period XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, and all foreclosure activity would cease. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, my usual statement listed attorney 's fees, other foreclosure expenses and my house was listed with XXXX XXXX GA for public auction for XX/XX/XXXX. I contacted SLS at their customer service number and was told that something was wrong because I was in a forbearance agreement. I emailed the bill collector - attorney and explained that I was in forbearance. I wrote the first letter of many to SLS who did nothing but canceled the sale for that date. I complained about them billing me for foreclosure expenses while under the forbearance agreement. In my next statement the legal fees associated with foreclosure were changed to "" corporate advances '' XXXX same amount for each item that was billed in the XX/XX/XXXX statement, and designated as foreclosure activity ). I wrote an overnight letter requesting a full disclosure of what the fees were and under what authority were they placing these corporate advancement fees on my account. The payment department in XXXX XXXX CO sent the letter back to me and told me that their billing office in XXXX CO handled account issues. I sent a copy of the letter to them, and as of today, I have heard nothing. On XX/XX/XXXX paid the reinstatement amount which included the corporate advances now billed as "" fees billed '' with no explanation."

Payoff statement dated XX/XX/2021, with a payoff amount of {$4000.00}. I requested an update to my credit reports to reflect the paid off mortgage loan. They updated my credit report to show a current balance of {$30000.00} and the account as closed. This must be corrected immediately as that false reporting has dropped my credit score by 22 points."
2021-02-03,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I have two CitiCards. An Awards ( ... XXXX ) card and a CitiAdvantage Card ( ... XXXX ) Sometime in early 2020, before XXXX, my card ending in XXXX, that I had not used for over 5 years was paid off complete. 

Payments were being made automatically to both accounts from my XXXX XXXX Checking Account. For some reason after the paying off my card ending in XXXX, my payments to card XXXX ( CitiAdvantage ) were being applied to my XXXX card. I discovered this error and contacted Citi, who promised to move the credit in XXXX to XXXX and update my payment history accordingly. Citi moved the credit to XXXX on XX/XX/2020, or thereabouts, but never updated my payment history as promised. As a result I immediately received a 60-90 past due on my credit report, which I did not know of until recently. 

Furthermore, my card ending in XXXX had received activity that was fraudulent after the XXXX correction. I never received a statement or notification in the mail about any activity. The disputed amount was reported to the credit agencies as still past due as recently as XX/XX/2021, however upon notifying Citi, their fraud department and customer service departments tell me that I have a negative {$35.00} balance ( credit ). 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received two letters from Citi ( attached ) stating that my credit information is correct and that I need to contact the credit agencies to let them know I'm disputing the information. 

I spoke with Citi again, XXXX - XXXX PST on XX/XX/2021 and was sent from department to department speaking to representatives in their fraud and customer services department only to be disconnected without resolution. 

I fear this really indicates Citi 's lack of security protocols and their inability to have any oversight to their credit card billing and management systems. Their lack of knowledge about their own processes is grossly expressed as their representatives appear to be mouthpieces to only drive their customers to give up due to their corporate direction of not really caring about their clients concerns. I am sure that I am not the only one going through this exhaustive process to right the wrong due to their negligence. 

I hope this is enough information to start this investigation. 

I plan on re-calling them as soon as send out this statement. 

All of the above can be confirmed if Citi releases all phone recordings and transcripts of my discussions and actions with them since XX/XX/2020. 

I can offer a copy of my credit report if needed. Every other creditor reports exceptional payment history except Citi.

When I went to close on the transaction, I was unable to and the business transaction was terminated because that documentation was never filed. When I called the company and ask them why they didn't file it, the admin. assistant literally said "" oh I don't know '' but we did get your documents. I then asked for a refund and she said no. I IMMEDIATELY contacted Elan to file the despites. Elan then proceeded to have me explain the situation and further WRITE it down TWICE and mail and fax it in. After going through all of that trouble, they sent me a letter this week saying that they can't do anything about it because my disputes were files after 60 days of the transaction.

It was in a car accident and paid off thru XXXX and the difference is what they are going after. Multiple times I tried working out a payment plan but they dont work with non profit credit organizations. They continued calling me and my employer took my phone away bc it was for business purposes. I am currently laid off so this intent to sue keeps me up at night. Its not a joke but my lively hood. I hope they would understand where I'm coming from. They have attempted to contact my previous employer so they are not happy about that.

2021-02-04,Mortgage,"I am being told that I need to pay for another XXXX, but I do not feel as if that is acceptable. Here is the timeline of events and why I believe I should not have to pay for another XXXX : XX/XX/XXXX - I paid for a XXXX  that was completed on this date. 
XX/XX/XXXX - I received a letter stating the value of the property was {$120000.00} and the value needed to be paid down {$8400.00} for the PMI to be removed. 
XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX I received a letter from NewRez stating I will need to submit a written request to have the PMI removed once I paid the value down to below 70 % and that the XXXX was good for 120 days from the completion of the valuation. Since the valuation was completed on XX/XX/XXXX, the valuation would be good until XX/XX/XXXX. 
XX/XX/XXXX - I submitted a check to be applied to PRINCIPAL BALANCE ONLY as noted in the memo line, and in the letter sent with the check. That balance was NOT applied to principal only and I had to call twice to have the corrected. 
XX/XX/XXXX - The principal only payment was corrected and the loan was paid to below {$84000.00}. 
XX/XX/XXXX - I submitted a request in writing to have the PMI removed, AS WELL AS a request to have the escrow removed. I have included the email below that I sent on XX/XX/XXXX. 
XX/XX/XXXX - I called your customer service line and spoke with XXXX who transferred me to the supervisor XXXX. I was told me request for PMI removal would be escalated. 

Since then I have called seven more times ( XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX again and XX/XX/XXXX ). I have spoken with 11 different people ( XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX- supervisor, XXXX , XXXX- Supervisor, XXXX XXXX , XXXX XXXX , XXXX, XXXX- supervisor , XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX ) to find out why my PMI request on XX/XX/XXXX had not been addressed. All 11 of those people stated they would either call me or email me back, and the only one that did is XXXX XXXX who called me back once to tell me she did not have an update for me. 

I paid my loan down to the amount you requested, well within the time frame you asked me to pay it down within, and I submitted a request in writing ( as shown below ) also well within that requested timeframe. Please tell me why I need to pay for another vacation."
2021-02-04,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I recently, submitted a dispute to XXXX  about the way Jared-Galleria Jewelry is reporting on my credit report. On, XX/XX/XXXX, I received a response back from XXXX stating that Jared-Galleria Jewelry has CERTIFIED AND VERIFIED the information to be "" Accurately '' reporting. I'm confused as to how this account could be VERIFIED AND CERTIFIED TO BE ACCURATE when there are several errors in the way this is being reported : 1 ) XXXX reports that this account was closed "" XX/XX/XXXX '' this is totally a contradiction to how it is being reported in the "" Payment History/Rating ''. Payment History clearly shows that this account was open in XXXX and did not close until the latter of XXXX. Secondly, XXXX reports that the "" High balance '' on this account is {$1400.00}. This totally confuses even the most expert because the credit limit is {$1500.00}. How could the Highest balance be lower then the credit limit? Next, XXXX  fails report the Date of First Delinquency which is required because it helps to identify the purge date. This all leads me to believe that XXXX  did not conduct a reasonable independent investigation. Using XXXX or parroting what a creditor says is not satisfactory for an independent investigation."
2021-02-09,Debt collection,CitiBank contacted me on XXXX XXXX claiming a past due balance on my Home Depot card. This is not the first time that have done this since the start of the pandemic. In XX/XX/XXXX it took 3 weeks for my payment by mail to be received. They continued to call my house everyday. My XXXX XXXX payment was mailed 2 weeks before the due date. Once again it appears that slow mail delivery is at fault. I refuse to allow them to make withdrawals from my bank account due to being a victim of attempted ID theft from XXXX. CitiBank reduced my credit limit after the XX/XX/XXXX incident and increased my interest rate. They will most likely do the same thing again over this case. The harassing phone calls have already started.

I have been attempting to remove fraudulent accounts from my credit report since XX/XX/2020 and for a process that should take no longer than 30 days, it has been over 240 days and I have neither received any investigation confirmation nor any result notices. The funny thing is, even the inaccurate personal information that was requested to be corrected, hasn't been done so. The fraud accounts are still showing on my report and it seems the bureaus are perfectly fine with violating my rights under the FCRA and the federal law. As stated, this is the last option before a lawsuit option is pursued."

The facts as follows : 1. Unauthorized use of card by merchant to renew membership products. 
2. Issuance of NSF fees due to XXXX 's approval. 
3. Dispute made to bank 4. Bank makes determination without providing customer with sufficient evidence of an investigation and policy application.

I received a call from XXXX @ XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX. XXXX stated they received my request for debt validation and proof of legal ownership to collect on a debt. 
XXXX informed me that they only keep statements/documents for up to a year and at this time they dont have any statements or paperwork to send me. 

XXXX informed me that I do not owe them anything and my account has been transferred to Pioneer/XXXX as of XX/XX/XXXX. I informed XXXX that XXXX is still reporting on my credit as of XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX stated that XXXX is no longer reporting and to send him a copy of my Credit Report. I informed him I provided XXXX a copy on my last CFPB complaint. XXXX stated XXXX credit department will handle that and there is no one I could be transferred to in that Department. 

Going back to Pioneer I recently received a letter stating they are trying to collect on a delinquent student loan debt. Pioneer mailed this letter to a old address in XXXX Michigan. The letter contained no Date. The letter stated they are trying to collect on a debt on the Full amount of {$130000.00}. I have no idea why I owe this debt. 
I sent Pioneer a debt validation letter on XX/XX/XXXX informing them I am requesting a detailed statement of this debt and interest I owe a legal standing to collect this debt by showing me : 1. Your lawful authority to collect without my consent or 2. A copy of the original contract between myself and the original creditor where I agreed to the assignment of the debt ; with my ink signature. 

I am very confused to why XXXX is reporting one debt to the Credit bureaus when they informed me they dont have any paperwork to why I owe them a debt but then they are able to validate with the Credit bureaus that I owe them a debt they dont own. 

I believe that XXXX has sold/given my information to Pioneer since they couldnt supply a validation of debt. Pioneer has stated calling me to collect on a delinquent debt that I know nothing about. No one want to provide me with any correct information. 

I am unable to find suitable employment because of this credit blemish. I am unable to obtain credit because of this credit blemish."

It is extremely frustrating that these company 's are allowed to do this to the average consumer like myself and hurt our chances of improving our positions in life.

2021-02-04,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","There was an inquiry on my XXXX  credit report from XX/XX/2020, that was a result of identity theft. I discovered this during a review of my credit report. I called XXXX and they told me to contact the reporting company. I immediately put a freeze on my credit reports. I called Credco who made the inquiry and was told that the inquiry was from XXXX XXXX. I spoke to the dealership manager who told me about the applicant who applied for the credit. I verified my information and proved it was not me who applied for the credit. I spoke to Credco and was told to file a police report and a report with Identitytheft.gov. I did both of these and emailed them the reports asking them to remove the inquiry from my credit report. 

When I spoke to XXXX at Credco today, she told me that they now require me to send them a copy of my social security number, my driver 's license, and a copy of a utility bill. I told her that they never requested that information before and asked her if I sent them the additional documents if they would immediately remove the inquiry from my report and she was not able to guarantee me that they would. I told her that the information they are requesting is very sensitive and I do not feel comfortable releasing this information to a company that has not been authorized to receive this information and they could use it to further steal my identity now that they have a copy of my social security card, driver 's license, and utility bill. How can I be sure that they are not part of the identity theft scam? 

In essence, I told her that they are re-victimizing me by refusing to remove a fraudulent inquiry in spite of proof from a police report which they requested."

2021-02-03,Student loan,"I was falsely under the impression that this loan was under a deferment or forbearance like other student loans during this international crisis. Apparently, this did not apply to my private student loan. 

This company, Mohela, has put me in financial dire straights before, forced me into bankruptcy, and caused immense amounts of stress on my family due to their horrible communication practices and unwillingness to assist in any way. 

In XXXX, I filed for bankruptcy under pressure from a defaulted student loanwith Mohela. This student loan had fallen into bad standing as I had called Mohela to file for an economic forbearance option and was not informed I had only placed this option on the federal student loan held by Mohela, not the private student loans they also serviced. 

I came out of bankruptcy in XXXX, expecting to have accounts reset and be able to start with a fresh slate, and Mohela had not done any of these things as my other accounts with other creditors had. My forbearances were never reset, I was out of any available options when financial hardships arose, as they had already exhausted these options prior to and during the bankruptcy. 

When the bankruptcy period was over, and payments resumed for this loan, they were entirely too high for my family to afford. We contacted Mohela to put a payment adjustment in place, and they do for a time, but it expires, and each time, we file for a new modification. They want more and more information, and they do not contact us to tell us it's missing. You must log in to the website to find details. 

This year, as stated before, I erroneously thought this company would be giving us relief due to the pandemic, and instead, what they did could only be considered postal harassment. We tried to apply for a payment deferment in XXXX, a payment modification, anything to help get us through, and they denied us for missing income verification. 

Now we are receiving letters telling me I have defaulted on this loan, and to contact the legal department, during a global pandemic, during an unprecedented time, and during a time when student loans were supposed to be offering relief. 

I am feeling backed into a corner here. They offer no options to help."

She even emailed me a letter from Midland Mortgage stating the information was inaccurate and should be removed from my credit report. I have a copy of the letter. My chief concern is that even after Midland Mortgage assured me they would rectify the inaccurate reporting, the credit bureaus still to this day are receiving information back from Midland Mortgage that my account is 90 days and 120 days past due for XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. Midland Mortgage must immediately correct their system and update the credit bureaus. Due to this inaccurate reporting, I was denied for a mortgage. I am beyond frustrated with Midland Mortgage and wish that they correct their errors."

They later informed me they had not received it. In XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke with a customer Support agent to verify that they had received it. I did not receive any additional communications or bills from XXXX after that date so assumed everything was resolved. 

This month, XXXX of XXXX, I received a notification that a collections had been placed on my XXXX and XXXX  credit reports by IC Systems. I have not received any communications from IC Systems. When I called IC Systems they informed me that the collections was in fact for the unreturned modem, and that they had been sending letters to the address provided by XXXX, where I lived up until XXXX of XXXX. The agent then told me they can not offer any resolution then abruptly disconnected from the call. Of course I never received these letters as they were sent to my old address. 

I checked and my current address is accurate on both my XXXX  and XXXX  credit reports, so would have been available for IC Systems to reference. 

Not only was this debt previously addressed with the original company, XXXX, I received no communications neither from XXXX nor IC Systems informing me they still considered the debt to be outstanding before it was reported to Credit Bureaus."

The Case ID is XXXX. The dispute is still ongoing and despite having more information that would help them decide in my favor. However, I called in and was told by a customer service agent that the merchant is claiming that I would have to send in a document explaining why the merchandise is defective. 

However, I was informed that I would have to find the document that would allow me to dispute this claim under notices and letters in my online account, dated XX/XX/XXXX. When I followed the customer service agents instructions to get there, the last notification was received on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I then was routed to a number of different customer service reps that have failed to find this document which will allow me to appeal this decision. Theyve already decided that I am liable for {$370.00}, which my tracking information XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX & XXXX ) shows was received back by the merchant on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX

4. Went to Citibank XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX branch and sat with banker with the intention of closing the account. 
5. Wanted to take the money and put it in a cashiers check to deposit in spouses account. Was told I needed to open a new account to transfer the money into to make a cashiers check, then could close the account ( could not close the old account while fraud investigation was taking place ).

2021-02-10,Credit card or prepaid card,"As a former XXXX XXXX for 36 years, I am writing to report what I feel are unfair and deceptive acts or practices made by both Citi Bank and XXXX XXXX. 
I recently received notification from the banks referenced above that my credit line has been lowered due the reasons listed below : Proportion of balances to credit limits is too high on bank revolving or other revolving accounts Lack of recent installment loan information Amount owed on revolving accounts is too high Time since most recent account opening is too short This deceptive practice is balance chasing which means that instead of freeing up credit, the customer has less available credit due to the lower credit limit. The banks are beginning to engage in this practice to limit their risk by reducing the amount of a particular borrowers available credit. 

Balance chasing is more likely to occur if the cardholder makes larger payments or may appear to be a high-risk borrower who makes late payments or defaults on other credit cards or loans. An unintended consequence of balance chasing is that even though debt repayment is responsible consumer behavior, it can make it difficult improve a credit score, such a FICO score. 

Another issue with this is that my credit utilization has increased since the banks reduced my credit line. It has also impacted my credit score making it much more difficult to be approved for credit so that I may consolidate my debt as I have done in the past. It is just a matter of time before I see a rate hike due to this unfair practice. 
My credit history has been solid, so it is not clear to me as to why there is a lack of recent installment loan information seeing that I had two automobile loans from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX and was paid in full on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, respectively. 

Please note that as of XX/XX/XXXX my credit score was XXXX and is currently reporting at XXXX as of XX/XX/XXXX. I have always made my payments in a timely manner and my credit has remained in good standing for many years despite what is stated above. 
The average age of my accounts is 7 years and 5 months with the oldest account 17 years and 6 months. 

My newest account was opened recently at a furniture store back on XX/XX/XXXX. I also had two personal loans I took out with XXXX XXXX that were paid in full as of XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX XXXX, XXXX. 

I understand that the economic conditions have worsened due to the COVID-19 pandemic and that may be a reason for banks showing their reluctance to lend. However, consumers that reflect a solid credit history with favorable credit scores should not be penalized. This appears to be another tactic to raise their interest rates and bottom line."

A few months later I opened a plain envelope to discover that I had a balance of several dollars. I called and they could not waive due to previous late fees waivers. I explained it was due to bank error and I am not responsible for a bank mistake. They had taken my payment as an account payoff. I asked for a return call from a supervisor since none was available. I never received one, nor did I receive one the next time I asked. I am trying to refinance my home and due to the impact of the delinquency on my credit card I did not qualify for the cheapest loan. I had to take one that is {$3000.00} more expensive in closing costs. The refinance can not close until this balance is gone.

4 i asked if there was another covid stimulus payment and i applied it to my account what would happen -- they responded that they would love the payment and were not sure if my line of credit would remain the same. 

Long and short citi cards at XXXX are destroying my credit and making it difficult to recover my credit score.

The reason for the large payment was to reduce the amount that i owed and get the maxed out line of credit off of my credit file. I certainly did my part my saving and making my payment on time so this line of acting is damaging to anyone who is trying to recover.

The fact that i am concerned with is that there is a lot of other people that once they are credit line maxed out their credit interest rate also will go up. I have seen other card that i have go up a point or 2 just because of this type of action."

2021-02-04,Mortgage,"I paid for the loan application fee. During the approval process our company merged with another company and my wife transferred her ownership to me. The entire time I stayed a W2 employee. they stated we suffered a income loss and wouldn't approve the loan. I have a credit score of XXXX, no debt but the two houses and a car lease. Income did not change. I think they figured out that this second house was on a leased lot with GA Power and they could not follow through with the rate they promised. They transferred my flood insurance to them as the beneficiary before we even closed. I had to track down my insurance agent and switch it back to my existing lender. Now that they denied the claim they won't cancel the loan request and stop requesting information to complete the process. I have left 6 phone messages, 10 emails and 10 text messages. I was assured on friday it would be taken care of by close of business. Still getting requests. Horrible response, will not return calls and will not complete what they promise. Horrible experience."

2021-02-06,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",I made an online purchase at XXXX using my store card on XX/XX/2019 and subsequently returned some items from the order within the same month. The balance on my card was not updated correctly to reflect the return and interest was applied to the amount of the returned item. That amount was not paid because I contested it with the credit card company and later a penalty was applied for not paying the interest. They inevitably reversed the amounts when they looked into the charges meanwhile they reported my payment history as 60+ days late in XX/XX/2019 and reduced my credit line. First of all it is impossible to be 60+ days late when not even 60 days could transpire between the purchase date and the month of their reporting. Second of all I was never late as the amount was never owed. Several attempts to resolve with the company have yielded zero results.

2021-02-05,Mortgage,"Hi, First off, my loan process was started on XX/XX/XXXX with XXXX XXXX with Sage Mortgage and I specifically selected Sage over XXXX  XXXX because of his wonderful communication and customer service from XXXX. I was able to upload all necessary documentation by XX/XX/XXXX and everything seemed to be going smoothly until XX/XX/XXXX. At this time, my emails and calls remained unanswered until XX/XX/XXXX. This was due to the fact that XXXX was no longer my loan officer. This was never communicated with me, nor contact information provided for the new loan officer. Instead my emails and phone calls simply went unanswered. From there, XXXX XXXX XXXX, my loan processor was the only one working on the loan and it seemed as if she could not access the information I had given to XXXX because duplicate information was requested. Even more concerning, I was told that the information I provided about my condominiums insurance policy was incorrect. So I contacted the insurance company with information given to Sage in order to attain the master policy. They were able to provide this the same day. Considering this is a service that Sage is charging me for, it is odd that I needed to do it for them. 

Thankfully on XX/XX/XXXX I was assigned a new loan officer, XXXX XXXX. His communication was great at first except he, like XXXX, was requesting information that I had already provided weeks ( if not, a month ) earlier. Unfortunately, that same day all communication from XXXX halted and he was unable to get a hold of via email, phone call, or text. Not until XX/XX/XXXX did he contact me again to let me know he couldn't communicate with me because of an issue with his licensure in Colorado. He then halted communication that same day and once again no communication has been provided about my loan. 

My rate has now been extended twice by XXXX. After multiple attempts at talk to a supervisor or manager for months I've yet had success. Please help me figure out what is going on with my loan."

They were the worst mortgage company I have ever had to deal with, they were very litigious with a legal department incessantly seeking opportunity to assess legal fees and force default.

They routinely assess fees basically for just holding the loan. If your property taxes or insurance goes up watch out as it will be a XXXX to assess additional fees and they will never communicate any of this beforehand and filing an appeal or compliant is useless.

when I called the company back, they had no idea what I was talking about and the person who made the call did not even send out the paperwork.

Our loan is backed by XXXX, but serviced through Wells Fargo. In XXXX we applied for and began a three month forbearance. On the Wells site it indicated that we would be able to delay the three months of payments and add them to the end of our mortgage. The exact thing that we have heard through the news. There was no indication that XXXX loans had different rules. 

After three months of forbearance, we were able to adjust our finances. We asked to resume our payments, and in XXXX began making our normal payments. Online we indicated we wanted to add the payments to the end of the loan. Also, a Wells representative called us and we established that we would be adding the payments to the end of the loan. 

A couple months later, we started getting paperwork and phone calls indicating that XXXX had different rules and would not add the payments to the end of the loan. They indicated we needed to pay the entirety of the three months of payments. This obviously would not be possible for us. 

We received in the mail an appraisal that Wells had ordered for our house. They requested copies of our taxes, pay stubs, and bank statements. Although we did not understand why they needed them, we submitted all requested documents. In XXXX we received even more document requests. We are not sure whether they are proving we make too much, or not enough for whatever they are working on. They insisted multiple times that it was XXXX that wanted the documents. The XXXX representative stated it was not their request. 

In the ten years we have had our mortgage, we have never missed or been late on a payment. On the thirteenth, we will be in "" default '' as the documents they are now requesting don't even exist and we won't be able to provide them. Things as silly as they want a "" Wet stamp '' rental contract versus the digitally signed contracts we use for our tenants.

I did not hear anything from LL Bean Mastercard via phone, email, or mail about a balance due.

My credit report, however, shows that I made late payments on this account for 7 months and that my account was 90 days past due. I disputed this with XXXX, but they did not change the information on my credit report. 

I believe my credit report should NOT reflect late payments made on this account, because I could not have paid a bill I never received.

2021-02-09,Credit card or prepaid card,"It started with myself looking at my finances as a whole. I called the credit card company and found out that there was a promotional balance transfer offer - and I took it. I transfered my balance from another card to this new card. I'd like to note the reasoning behind this action : My goal was to show a lower credit card utilization percentage. The card I transferred from was almost 100 % and the card I was transferring to had such a high credit limit ( mind you, I haven't use this card in a while! ) so after I transfer to this new card, the utilization percentage would be roughly around 50 % and the prior card would now be at 0 % - this action would improve my credit score as I continue to pay off my debt. 

About 1-2 weeks later I received an email saying that my credit limit decreased after a review of my credit reporting. ( attached ) This was alarming so I called the credit card company to try and rectify this. I was pretty upset of course because this now defeated the purpose of me transfering my money to this new credit card banking company. My question was - why, after I recently transfer money does the company want to 'review my account ' and lower my limit. If my credit reporting history has been the same for a while now, then why didn't they want to lower it beforehand. Also - why would they approve the balance transfer offer to me? 

I don't find this action professional from this company at all. 

When I spoke to the representative over the phone, I was able to get transferred to a supervisor ( they told me this person was anyways ) and they put a request in to 'raise my credit limit '. I didn't think this was the correct procedure to do honestly. I new it would go through as a normal request - not a special case request as my phone call into them was pertaining to. I feel this was on a whole different level where it should have been handled differently. So of course, I received a denial letter ( attached ). 

I don't feel this was right or handled properly. This action did worse to my credit report. I honestly wish I just never did the transfer. I am looking into any options that I have to get this rectified. The very least, I want to pull my money back out from them and move it to another credit card banking company. They do not deserve my money for what took place."

I called Citibank asking for a reason to this action and they explained that due to money received from the SBA into a personal account and not enough documentation, they were going to return the money to SBA in a period of 30-60 days. In XX/XX/XXXX, I got another letter from Citibank explaining that the money was going back to the SBA. 
Today is the date that Citibank has not returned the money to the SBA. I called the bank today XX/XX/XXXX and they said that the process was going to take between 30-60 days.

This was important to me because I am still several months away from purchasing. There was a section that has disclosures that I clicked through but did not read through all of them. I am assuming that these disclosures had a statement that they were going to do a hard pull to my credit because I received a notice from my credit service that stated that a hard pull was done. I then received a call from a rep from AmeriSave who confirmed that they did a hard pull. Since they boldly and specifically stated that they were not doing a hard pull and I did not provide my date of birth or social security number, I had no expectation that my credit was being pulled.

2021-02-10,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan","Citibank is engaging in unlawful, deceptive, & misleading business practices in violation of federal statute New York GBL 349. Citibank markets a Paycheck Protection Program ( PPP ) on a national level. Citibank provides business owners with a list of the required documentation necessary to apply for a PPP loan. Businesses rely on the provided list and submit the required documents. Despite submitting all of the required documentation, Citibank conveniently advises their business clients that they are unable to verify payroll and categorically deny the applications. At the time that businesses contact Citibank by telephone, they are informed that a telephone number for the PPP Department does not exist and that all inquiries should be sent by email. As opposed to its competitor national banks such as XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX which both have dedicated PPP Department customer service representatives assisting business clients with PPP applications, Citibank makes it impossible to receive the assistance that businesses not only desperately need to financially survive but also deserve as loyal business clients. Afterall, PPP applications must be submitted to the bank where businesses have accounts. When businesses send emails to the provided email, they receive generic emails which cause immense confusion, aggravation, and unnecessary delays. This is because the email responses do not clarify what, if anything, is missing from files in order to obtain approval. By way of limited example, email responses provide information regarding loan forgiveness which is irrelevant because a PPP loan has not yet even been approved, thus making forgiveness options irrelevant. On another example, email responses provide a telephone number, but the provided phone number is for general Citibank inquiries and the representatives advise that they have no information regarding PPP loans. Yet, on another example, email responses advise businesses to reapply. However, upon re-applying and again submitting all of the required documentation specifically following the required documentation list provided by Citibank, businesses once again receive emails stating, unable to verify payroll. Citibank fails to advise business clients as to the exact resolution measures. Citibanks unlawful, deceptive, & misleading business practices cause tremendous financial issues for businesses attempting their very best to survive during these uncertain times. I respectfully request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau investigate Citibanks unlawful business practices and implement penalties accordingly.

Trustmark bank, who held the construction note, then agreed to provide accommodations by modifying the loan, lowering the rate, deferring the current payment that had matured, and amortizing it for 240 payments. The span of time between when the construction loan matured, and when the underwriting for both the mortgage division, and the bank itself was complete was approximately 90 days. For this time period, the bank charged interest for the time value of the balance, but at the same time it reported the note as delinquent ( see exhibit H ). 
In Summary, My complaints are against Both Trustmark National Bank and Trustmark Mortgage for the following reasons : 1. Trustmark National Bank provided accommodations as defined in Section 4021 of the CARES Act, while being aware of, and in full knowledge that this issue was directly affected by COVID 19. 
2. Trustmark bank violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act as well as Section 4021 of the CARES Act in reporting the covid related accommodations as delinquent.

3. The illegal/erroneous reports by Trustmark National Bank, has caused financial harm to me.

4. Both the loan officer, and branch president have been notified in writing of the incorrect reporting, but as to date, they either refuse to respond to the email, or otherwise have failed to respond. When confronted in person, the branch president stated his position to be that he had made no errors and would make no corrections. 

I have made every effort to pursue this through the channels available to me, such as filing disputes with the bank and various agencies including the credit reporting bureau experian. Now as there have been no corrections, I will pursue litigation if this avenue is not successful.

2021-02-10,Vehicle loan or lease,"I refinanced my car with XXXX XXXX Credit Union on XXXX. They sent a check to Hyundai Motor Finance to pay off my loan and the check was cashed on XXXX. XXXX claims that they can not locate the payment made and that there is nothing they can do.

2021-02-09,Mortgage,"My husband and I were exposed to XXXX and were were forced to quarantine for 14 days in XXXX of XXXX, and then actually did get XXXX in XXXX of XXXX. We applied for mortgage forbearance in XX/XX/XXXX through the Cares Act and were approved for 60 days. When we were out of the forbearance period, I applied for reinstatement of normal mortgage payments with the two missed payments to be attached to the end of the loan. We have significant equity in our home that we have lived in for almost 8 years, and my husband and I both have excellent credit, so there was no reason this should not have been approved. The mortgage company, Lakeview Loan Servicing, instead created an entirely new loan for us with the same interest rate, but of course a new amortization schedule, which will cost us XXXX  of dollars in the long-run due to more of our payments going to interest versus principal for the next several years. The customer service rep I spoke to said that this is the only option for VA loans. This is ridiculous and was never explained to us when we applied for forbearance. This is a very sad situation that this mortgage company would treat military veterans this way, and the worst part is that most people would not realize the financial impact the new amortization schedule has and would have no idea that this was a bad thing. In my opinion, this is an unfair business practice and the company should be investigated as such."

2021-02-10,Credit card or prepaid card,"As a XXXX XXXX XXXX for 36 years, I am writing to report what I feel are unfair and deceptive acts or practices made by both U.S. Bank. 
I recently received notification from the banks referenced above that my credit line has been lowered due the reasons listed below : Proportion of balances to credit limits is too high on bank revolving or other revolving accounts Lack of recent installment loan information Amount owed on revolving accounts is too high Time since most recent account opening is too short This deceptive practice is balance chasing which means that instead of freeing up credit, the customer has less available credit due to the lower credit limit. The banks are beginning to engage in this practice to limit their risk by reducing the amount of a particular borrowers available credit.

Balance chasing is more likely to occur if the cardholder makes larger payments or may appear to be a high-risk borrower who makes late payments or defaults on other credit cards or loans. An unintended consequence of balance chasing is that even though debt repayment is responsible consumer behavior, it can make it difficult improve a credit score, such a FICO score. 
Another issue with this is that my credit utilization has increased since the banks reduced my credit line. It has also impacted my credit score making it much more difficult to be approved for credit so that I may consolidate my debt as I have done in the past. It is just a matter of time before I see a rate hike due to this unfair practice. 
My credit history has been solid, so it is not clear to me as to why there is a lack of recent installment loan information seeing that I had two automobile loans from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX and was paid in full on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, respectively. 
Please note that as of XX/XX/XXXX my credit score was XXXX and is currently reporting at XXXX as of XX/XX/XXXX. I have always made my payments in a timely manner and my credit has remained in good standing for many years despite what is stated above. 
The average age of my accounts is 7 years and 5 months with the oldest account 17 years and 6 months. 
My newest account was opened recently at a furniture store back on XX/XX/XXXX. I also had two personal loans I took out with XXXX XXXX that were paid in full as of XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX XXXX, XXXX. 
I understand that the economic conditions have worsened due to the COVID-19 pandemic and that may be a reason for banks showing their reluctance to lend. However, consumers that reflect a solid credit history with favorable credit scores should not be penalized. This appears to be another tactic to raise their interest rates and bottom line."

Moreover when it was received it was NOT applied as an escrow shortage but instead as a regular monthly installment. I called my mortgage serviced and they apologized and advised they would reverse the payment and apply it correctly. The representative confirmed it was an oversight in his end. Today, I look at my account again and they payment had been reversed and applied to escrow ; nonetheless the monthly installment still shows my shortage as not paid and the payment continues to show the amount that would have been due if it was not paid. This is unfair and unethical. They tell you to pay one amount and take your money ; however its sitting in limbo and not applied as advised. This is a UDAAP violation.

After battling with them, they finally closed it on all my reports, BUT they continue to report it every month showing I owe more and more and more money and that it is is late and past due and in collections, despite being closed. XXXX has been contacted and they are CORRECTLY reporting the debt as discharged in XXXX XXXX they said they tried to notify PHEAA to stop collecting, but XXXX has not taken their direction and there is nothing more that XXXX  can do at this point. I have contacted XXXX and they REFUSE to admit they purchased a debt to collect on that was illegal and they are NOT entitled to collect because of the XXXX  XXXX discharge. They refuse to take it OFF ALL credit reporting agencies OR stop reporting it as late/Collections, despite it having been discharged. 

See the Discharge Paperwork that has very specific language regarding discharge as to ALL student loans. Mine was a hardship case from an injury and loss of a business. I am now XXXX and will never work again and the judge knew that I would never be able to repay the student loan so it WAS in fact discharged in 2018. XXXX knows this, so why XXXX is STILL trying to collect and reporting as LATE payments, I can not figure out, or WHY it is being allowed!!!!!"

2021-02-05,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","In XXXX of 2017, I opened a checking account with Bank of America. In XXXX of 2017, I deposited a check into the account that ended up being drawn on an account that had just been closed, although I did not know it. My account was immediately frozen. I called customer service, and they told me what had happened and suggested that I go speak to the manager of the bank branch where I had opened the account, who should be able to lift the freeze. 

When I went to the bank to see the manager, I was accompanied by my XXXX  granddaughters, who are XXXX. The manager stared at them, and it was obvious to me that because he was white, he was making a XXXX judgment on me ( I'm also white ) for having XXXX grandchildren. He was very rude to me and told me that because the deposit I made was returned, it caused several checks I had written to bounce. Although the account was not overdrawn, because I had bounced a check in the first 30 days, he said that bank had to close my account. The manager returned to me the money that was still in the account, and closed it during my visit. He assured me that there would be no negative reporting ramifications from the closure, as it was not my fault. 

Recently, I attempted to open an account with a different bank and was denied. I obtained a copy of my XXXX  Report ( as recommended by the denying bank ) to see why I had been denied, and I noted that Bank of America had reported me to XXXX in 2017, indicating they had closed my account due to "" suspected fraud ''. This is completely inaccurate. The XXXX report also indicated that I had an unpaid amount owed to BofA as a result of the closed account, which is also inaccurate. 

I contacted BofA several times to request that they remove the false information from XXXX, but the customer service reps I spoke with said they were unable to do so, but could not provide me any valid reason why ( as they agreed with me as to why my account had been closed and confirmed I did not owe BofA any money ). 

The false and negative report by Bank of America to XXXX is preventing me from opening any bank accounts, which I need to do for my small business. I am being harmed severely every day that the false information remains on the report."

When I asked more about the situation they said that if I was not willing to settle the debt that I would be charged and they would garnish wages up to {$7000.00}! So I said that is absolutely insane as I don't remember ever having a Citi Bank credit card, and they agreed to allow me to settle the debt for the original settlement amount from XXXX for {$1200.00}. I agreed to pay this fee and then I looked up the company and it does not seem legit! I got a receipt from them via email and also had to sign an agreement about the payment of which I still have the PDF for."

At this time that was the only money I had to pay my bills for weeks, I was diagnosed with XXXX and was out of work for the next two weeks without pay. I contacted the bank and they told me at first that I made the transfer myself then said it was internal but could not explain why at that time someone else explained it went to my parents account giving me all the details of their account and what happened which they should not have done.

First it is for unit and flood because there was some sort of mix up and they didn't get info at closing, ok. The next was for condominium master policy which is paid by the association and covered through our HOA dues. They want us to submit proof every year that the association has insurance or they will purchase a policy for us so that we would be double paying. What? Now they are telling us even though XXXX sends them the bill every year, we have to contact Suntrust and tell them that we are renewing with XXXX for flood and wall to wall or they will automatically purchase their preferred insurance for us. In essence, we have to contact them XXXX times over the course of a 30 yr loan. They can not put it in their system to automatically pay XXXX every year unless we tell them otherwise.

The following morning, despite more than {$4100.00} being deposited into the account, I learned that the check was "" returned '' and an overdraft fee of {$35.00} was charged. 

After speaking with several representatives at the bank, XXXX ( XXXX ) confirmed that the bank erred in several important ways, and is clearly misleading customers about their available balances. XXXX confirmed that she would file an internal complaint on the following issues, and I stated that I would do the same. 

These issues are : Mobile and web apps - The bank 's own apps are providing incorrect and misleading Account Balances. The bank claims that, only on the web app, there is a separate area of the app that shows which checks have "" posted '' and therefore, what the actual account balance is. This is incredibly misleading to average consumers, such as myself. I have been a customer of this bank for more than a decade, and this has never happened before. I have attached a screenshot which confirms that {$290.00} was remaining in the account after the check was withdrawn, proving that the check should not have been returned. 

Overdraft Fee - I was told that the Overdraft Fee can not be returned to me while "" processing. '' XXXX confirmed that this is incorrect and she returned it to me. 

Overdraft Protection -My Overdraft Protection was linked to a closed savings account, yet I was not told this, so the checking account did not pull from the correct account when it needed to. XXXX confirmed that this is incorrect and misleading.

I recently refinanced my existing JUMBO home 1st mortgage with Bank of America and also maintain a HELOC with BofA. During the refinancing process ( for the mortgage ) I requested a modest increase to my unused HELOC ( figuring it would be easier to get it all done at once ). I was told by my mortgage banker ( XXXX XXXX XXXX NMLS # XXXX ) that it would be easier to increase the HELOC after we closed the first mortgage. Now I am being told ( post closing of refinancing ) that an increase to my HELOC would require an exception that BofA can not accommodate. This would have been helpful information to know prior to closing and paying nearly {$50000.00} of closing and refinancing costs. I find it unconscionable that after working with Bank of America in good faith and incurring massive costs that I now find myself forced to seek out an alternative HELOC AFTER Bank of America effectively locked me into a mortgage refinancing at a significant UPFRONT cost to me. I was clearly mislead. My refinancing business was sought after by several competing institutions but I decided to stay with BofA given the long relationship. 

Again, my HELOC request was raised during the 1st mortgage home refinancing process and I was told we will handle it after the mortgage is closed. At no time was I made aware there may be the need for exceptions."

My concern is with my mortgage payment and I need verification that we will not be charged any fees for late payments. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I mailed check number # XXXX to the company. This was for the Escrow shortage of the year. The check was for {$330.00}. As of today, this check has still not been cashed or processed. Secondly, on XX/XX/XXXX, I mailed in our monthly mortgage payment in the amount of {$2400.00}. This was check number # XXXX. 

After trying to get thru to this company and not being able to, I placed a stop payment on the check # XXXX and paid a {$30.00} fee with my bank to get this accomplished. I then completed a onetime payment on the website of {$2500.00} on XX/XX/XXXX so that our monthly payment would be covered, and we would not get a late fee. 

I then got notification that the check # XXXX has cashed! You can imagine my annoyance when this cleared. This check was returned, and I was charged a fee. 

At this time, the check for the shortage of {$330.00} has also been returned and we have a late fee on the account."

At that time, it cited as its decision : *Utilization of your credit is too high *Current or past delinquency with one or more of your creditors *Too many consumer finance company accounts For more than a year, I have been renovating my home, so my credit utilization that BOA felt is too high is reflective of those renovations. My credit is current and well-managed. I disagree with BOA 's assessment of my credit utilization, but there appears to be little that I can do about this issue. However, I adamantly object to the remaining two reasons that BOA cited -- delinquencies and finance companies on my credit report. 

There were no delinquencies or finance companies listed on my credit report when I requested the credit increase in XXXX of XXXX. Therefore, when I submitted my complaint to CFPB in XXXX of XXXX, I specifically requested that BOA state exactly what delinquencies and finance companies it identified. 

In late XXXX of XXXX, I received a written response from a BOA representative named XXXX XXXX. Mr. XXXX regurgitated exactly what was stated in the original letter of denial that was sent to me in XXXX of XXXX. Mr. XXXX failed to satisfy my request to specifically state exactly what delinquencies and finance companies it identified. 

I faithfully review my credit file at the start of each year because I do not like surprises. I know exactly what is on my credit report. All errors or items of concern that I find are immediately reported for correction, which is why I am requesting that BOA/Mr. XXXX clearly identify by name the items that it cited as the reason for its decision. BOA is either deliberately misrepresenting the information it alleges is in my credit report or it is reviewing inaccurate information -- information that is not on the reports that I review every single year. I am attempting to get to the bottom of a problem that BOA alleges exists. Since it is making statements that I know are inaccurate, it must clarify those statements.

The Navy Federal Credit Union, however, does not provide an electronic copy on their website. 

I called to ask for the electronic copy, but the customer service manager responded that the Navy Federal Credit Union only sends paper versions by mail. I explained that every other financial institution provided electronic copies, which should be standard after the pandemic started 10 months ago. The Navy Federal Credit Union refused. 

I explained that every other business has adopted to operating during the pandemic by providing documents electronically and that I would need the electronic copy to respond to requests by the IRS by email. This is quite frustrating and antiquated. 

Does the CFPB provide guidance to financial institutions for providing electronic copies of documents, especially during the pandemic? Thanks very much."

We were pursuing a refinance/reverse mortgage and credit report showed 2 obligations ( HELOC ). I went back through records and found the paperwork ( from XXXX ) with payoff, acknowledgement that the account would be closed and no further advances made, copy of payoff letter and check. I contacted BOA in XX/XX/XXXX ; customer service insisted the loan was never closed and we owed the money. When I said we had sold the property, the representative said it would now be listed as an unsecured loan. I requested transaction history, as well as documentation showing that we authorized the loan to be reopened, and provided copies of the payoff documents. The transaction history showed advances during a couple of months in XXXX. I pulled deposit history for all of our accounts for that period and none of the deposits matched the dates or amounts in the transaction history. I contacted BOA on numerous occasions, both in writing and by telephone, and always got the same answer.
