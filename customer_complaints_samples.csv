"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","XXXX is currently reporting incorrect information to all three of my credit bureaus. If the information all comes from the same source why is the reporting inaccurate? the dates opened are not the same on all three bureaus, the credit limit is not all the same on all three bureaus and the high credit is also incorrect on all three bureaus. Being that it is not reporting correctly who says that the information reported is accurate. Please delete this account from all three bureaus asap."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","For over two years no one including myself has been able to pull my credit report from Experian. Two years ago I submitted all the documentation that they requested to prove my identity and my address. Still no one including myself call pull my credit report from Experian. This has prevented me from obtaining credit and most importantly from refinancing my home. I have called them almost daily for the past two weeks. I have been told that I will receive calls from an escalated ticket. No one has called. I finally received an email on Sunday XX/XX/2021 basically saying that the ticket was closed, pay for an account with Experian to get further assistance. So I called today and was told that I needed an account with Experian. Then I was told that I had to call back in 72 hours to receive an assistance. I have spent more than 15 hours on the telephone trying to get Experian to fix a problem that they have created. It has to be a problem with Experian because I can pull my credit report just fine from XXXX  and XXXX. I feel as though I am being held XXXX."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","FICO CREDIT SCORE DROPPING W/O VALID REASON! 

In the month of XX/XX/XXXX, I was notified TWICE by Experian, that my FICO score had dropped - once by 9 points on XX/XX/XXXX from XXXX to XXXX and again by 3 points on XXXX XXXX to XXXX. I ran a credit report on XXXX XXXX which states at it's very end about my FICO Score 8 - "" you have NO negative factors impacting your score ''. This report states 1 ) No missed payments 2 ) Long Credit History ( 23+ yrs ) 3 ) Recent card usage 4 ) Substantial installment loan repayment ( mortgage ) I have 2 Credit cards & I pay them in FULL monthly ( exceptional payment history ) & we pay extra on our declining balance on our joint mortgage ( never missed a payment ). 

I called Experian about this matter TWICE. I called on Sat. XX/XX/XXXX & was advised to call on a weekday. I called on Monday, XXXX at XXXX XXXX & was rebuffed from speaking with a Supervisor & also told that there was NO EXPLANATION to give for this. He agent stated "" I am not a credit repair person '' - he gave me a laundry list of "" why '' a FICO score could decline, but NONE of them apply. He had nothing else to offer except to try to SELL me "" credit repair '' services that I do not need. I was NOT given ANY further opportunity to address this matter with Experian. 

I am concerned about my FICO score dropping further and further, as there is no evidence of any fraud & I AM using my credit responsibly & paying my bills in FULL monthly. I feel I may be targeted or something as I have no explanation for how someone with a decent income, who is receiving e-mails from Experian congratulation them on "" low utilization '' and other such markers, could then have them drop their FICO score? I do not know if it is because of my age or gender, but it seems to be not tied to my actual credit usage, payments or income, or any other actual markers."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",I am requesting a method of verification of this bankruptcy on my credit report.
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Dear Credit Reporting Agency : I am an identity theft victim. I am writing to dispute the following items on my credit report. Each of the accounts and transactions I dispute were opened and made by the thief, not by me. I never authorized, used, or benefited from these accounts or transactions in any way.

Checking or savings account,On XX/XX/XXXX i opened a dedicated account for my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. This account is solely meant for deposits from ssi for back payments After a year and 2 installment payments we were anticipating the 3rd and final installment from social security. Due to covid -19 pandemic social security did not deposit the 3rd installment on XX/XX/XXXX which was the expected date. I had a check to cash at wellsfargo for financial aid so i went into to speak with the banker i told him how i recieved the information from social security about the deposit expected to be late due to being backlogged and the fee that was assessed to my account after just resolving it. He told me the fee bringing the account to a negative would not affect the deposit. The week following the deposit wasnt there So i returned to the bank branch where i opened the account and told them the problem and how it didnt have a check mark for direct deposit as services we had and offered to clear the fee assessed to the account in case that would disrupt the account in good standing and the substantial deposit we are expecting i wasnt too sure about the rules tho concerned about ssi policies for deposits made to account i was assured once again by the banker the account was available and ready for the deposit and not to take care of the fee because the seposit from ssi would take care of it and the deposit wouldnt be affected by it. I told the banker once again they were backlogged and the deposit would be late she assured me the account would be ready 3 days later they closed the account due to inactivity and a negative balance i called and the representative told me the account would be back open in 3 days but no we are XXXX because wells fargo lied to us

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",I am unable to get errors on my credit report fixed through Experian nor can I get my report mailed. I have tried to call the company multiple times without being able to speak with a representative.
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I have sent Experian a letter on XX/XX/2020 disputing wrong addresses, phone numbers and employment information. I have attached a file that shows the U.S. Postal Certified Mail receipt as proof and they did not remove the inaccurate information. The following incorrect personal information is listed below : Addresses : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, WISCONSIN XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, WISCONSIN XXXX Employment : XXXX XXXX XXXX Phone Numbers : XXXX XXXX I request that Experian remove the inaccurate addresses, phone numbers and employment information listed above, being that I have no association with this information."
Debt collection,this fraudulent account with SEQUIUM ASSET SOLUTIONS account # XXXX balance XXXX this account is fraud i never had any of these accounts they are all fraudulent.
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","To Whom It May Concern, This is my third time filing this complaint about Experian. I have recently been informed that there is negative information reported in the file maintained under my Social Security number. Upon reviewing a copy of my credit report, I see a negative entry for XXXX XXXX on account # XXXX. 

Experian claims they contacted the data furnisher to verify the accuracy of the information with which I disagree. Experian further claims the data furnisher has verified the accuracy of the disputed information and the results summary was sent to me, XX/XX/XXXX, for review. 

Please do not base your decision on a previous investigation. I have attached pertinent information supporting my request! I am enclosing an official statement on company letterhead from XXXX XXXX XXXX dated XX/XX/XXXX indicating account # XXXX has been paid in full and should be removed from my credit profile immediately. Whatever investigation Experian conducted before is null. 

Once again, I challenge the accuracy, compliance and reportability of this listing. I implore you to have Experian validate this information with the original creditor and provide me with copies of any documentation associated with this account. 

I formally request that this information be immediately deleted from the credit file maintained under my Social Security number. Please do not allow Experian to continue reporting this inaccuracy. This is against the law! 

Your prompt attention to this matter is greatly appreciated, XXXX XXXX"
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I submitted formal letters enclosing copies of my SSN card, current state driver 's license both of which contained my correct personal information, including my legal name and correct residential address. These letters were sent from XXXX through XX/XX/2020. 

This information was submitted to Experian, XXXX, and XXXX on numerous occasions, IN WRITING, providing all related documentation to prove my legal name, address, and correct SSN. 

To date, these credit-reporting agencies have REFUSED to remove all erroneous information. THEY ARE REPORTING ADDRESSES OF CITIES AND STATES I HAVE NEVER RESIDED IN AND HAVE NEVER VISITED. THEY ARE REPORTING SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS THAT ARE NOT MINE. THEY ARE REPORTING NAMES THAT I HAVE NEVER USED. NONE OF THESE NAMES ARE MY LEGAL NAME AND DO NOT APPEAR ON MY SSN CARD."
Mortgage,"In XXXX I had contacted my current lender, Freedom Mortgage, about a refinance of my existing loan with them. They followed-up quickly and said they needed to wait for the required VA seasoning period before we could proceed. After that period had passed we reengaged and I was sent a final closing disclosure and scheduled for a closing on XX/XX/2021 at my home at XXXX. I was contacted at XXXX by the law firm and told the closing had to be cancelled because Freedom Mortgage failed to get them the required documents. I contacted Freedom Mortgage that day and learned that they were unable to determine a projected property tax for escrow. I notified them that this was originally part of a trust and that the bill wouldn't be generated until XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX. They stated they would contact XXXX County, SC to get an estimate to use for the tax certificate. Once I had been assured that had happened on XX/XX/2021 I scheduled for a closing on XX/XX/2021 at XXXX at my home. I was contacted at by the law firm at XXXX and told the closing had to be cancelled and to contact Freedom Mortgage for further details. I contacted Freedom Mortgage and was told that they had the same issue about the tax certificate. I had been assured it was cleared up, but surely enough it wasn't. When I spoke to a representative for the "" exceptions department '' on the phone I was told they had two different tax amounts and couldn't proceed until they received confirmation from the tax authority. That is now twice in two months, with the closing scheduled 12 calendar days in advance that Freedom Mortgage was unable to execute a scheduled mortgage closing for an IRRRL due to their inability to gather and relate information competently. I have made inquiries to other companies as this process has proceeded causing a dip in my credit scores as well as having to cancel on my required witnesses who had cleared their schedules."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Several times the XXXX account and some XXXX account was removed as it was the result of fraud and added back in with no notice and no new additional information provided to validate said debt it was added back based on the the same information as when it was deleted both accounts are the result of fraud not only that but several times the creditor collect accounts for these have been removed and re added under new names with no new information to prove said debt
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",I have repeatedly asked the credit bureau to verify information on a report. they have refused to verify the information provided by XXXX XXXX XXXX. They have listed the item of verified and refused to say how they verified. I have talked to the original vendor and even they agree the information is not correct. they have failed to follow the rules and verify the account. I have even hired a law firm to send them letters and they have not responded.
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","At this time, I respectfully request a copy of my Experian, XXXX and XXXX XXXX credit report. I dont know why all of my written requests have been ignored, but it would be greatly appreciated if each credit reporting agency will mail out a copy of my credit report to XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, NY XXXX. Your professional cooperation will be greatly appreciated. 
XXXX XXXX"
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",THIS ACCOUNT WAS INCLUDED IN A CHAPTER XXXX AND CONVERTED TO A CHAPTER XXXX. THE ACCOUNT WAS REMOVED AT ONE TIME FROM MY CREDIT FILE AND THEN IT SHOWED BACK UP FROMWHAT I AM ASSUMING IS A 3RD PARTY THAT PURCHASED THE LOAN FROM REGION FINANCE AND THEY ADDED BACK TO MY CREDIT FILE TO TRY AN COLLECT ON THE ACCOUNT. I HAVE NOTIFIED XXXX XXXX/ EXPERIAN AND NOE OF THEM WILL ASSIST WITH INVESTIGATING OF REMOVING THE ACCOUNT FROM MY CREDIT FILE. THE ACCOUNT BALANCE CONTINUES TO INCREASE WITH INTEREST ON A MONTHLY BASIS SO I AM ASSUMING THE ACCOUNT WAS SOLD TO A 3RD PARTY THAT IS TRYING TO MAKE MORE MONEY OFF OF THE LOAN THAT IS NO LONGER COLLECTIBLE DUE TO BANKRUPTCY.
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","It is impossible for me to fix my credit. I do everything I possibly can and items that are 100 % false and incorrect never come off my report. It will drop XXXX points in a day with no explanation. Ive got barely any debt and it doesnt reflect a correct debt to income ratio nor does it ever seem to get above XXXX when I have paid off student loans, pay CCs on time, have no mortgages or bankruptcies and a bunch of items that are medical bills that didnt bill my insurance when I was fully medically insured ; I dispute them and they deny my claim but dont give me reasons why. Im XXXX and work daily for years to fix my credit and its impossible due to obfuscation, misinformation, wrong information, and inability to properly dispute flagrantly incorrect or fraudulent items. I need to buy a home and move forward with my life and this is making it impossible to do so. Please address Experian, XXXX XXXX XXXX  Accordingly."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",My credit score was lowered by Experian 38 points stating XXXX XXXX XX/XX/21 and XX/XX/21. XXXX XXXX has advised me they did not report me to the credit bureau. Once again I feel targeted by Experian. Experian violated credit laws by not removing a delinquent account off my credit due to a failure of the creditor providing the documentation. Now they are hitting my credit score repeatedly.
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",This was a XXXX XXXXXXXX bill from my college days. It was the responsibility of my roommate and I don't know how or why my information is on it for them to say I owed money. I called the company about it and the rep I spoke with said it would be removed if I paid it in full. They lied!!!! Its still on my credit.
Debt collection,"I am a Federally Protected Consumer. The Fair Debt Collection Practice Act is intended to secure my right to privacy and is intended to protect consumers against abusive, and deceptive debt collection practices, and I have been abused and deceived by USAA Federal Savings Bank. USAA Federal Savings Bank has knowingly and willfully violated the Truth in Lending Act. Truth and Leading TILA The Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) was enacted by Congress to promote the informed use of consumer credit and I have been uninformed so be it. I am a Consumer and Veteran who has fought for this Country and USAA Federal Savings Bank would rather use misleading information and deceptive forms to collect on an alleged debt that has been paid for through a consumer credit transaction. This is unauthorized use of my credit card 15 USC 1602 ( p ). Please see attached"
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Please remove collection account opened on XX/XX/2020 from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX on the amount of {$1400.00}. This account has been fully paid off. Attached is the letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX. Please update credit reports immediately. 

Thanks, XXXX XXXX"
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",No response on the 30 day investigation on the hard inquiries reporting on my credit report and its been well past 30 days
Debt collection,"I do not owe this debt and the balance date is inaccurate. They formerly had this account.They reported the debt to my credit on XX/XX/XXXX, NOT in XX/XX/XXXX. I have historical proof! I have recorded alerts via XXXX  XXXX portal that shows when the agency first reported to the credit bureaus about this debt. The collection agency is practicing illegal acts : Ability Recovery Services , LLC located at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, PA XXXX. They have been on my credit file before XXXX but they are reporting the account in their office as new as of XX/XX/XXXX. The account they have is more than a year old. That is illegal. Please have them to stop harassing me, as I do not owe this debt. Thanks in advance!"
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Requested a credit card product change from Citi for coverting Citi XXXX XXXX XXXX credit card to XXXX XXXX XXXX credit card. The card was converted but credit report was hard pulled without consent. No warning was given that a hard credit inquiry will be done for changing credit card products even though credit line remained the same.
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","This company is without a doubt one of the most unscrupulous ones out there. I have constant issues with them especially with regards to them failing to apply payments, changing due dates, adjusting available credit weeks after payments already cleared.

I was enrolled in 3 different programs for covid been there for 8 years never late and i paid as well based on their directives and they reported me late for XXXX and XX/XX/2020. Never been late in 8 years didnt start now. 

Just because they repeatedly lie about it i started screenshots of everything nightly. They are now saying i didnt make a payment before XX/XX/XXXX which you clearly see attached i made the payments and more and they fraudulently added on a late fee yet again. They also have yet to refund a cancelled transaction from XX/XX/2020 which is just how they are - beware"
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","XXXX reported to Experian that my account was closed and a charge-off, but I have never made a late payment and I don't carry more than a {$100.00} balance ( {$3000.00} credit limit ). The problem I am having is my other credit card company XXXX said they received information from Experian about this XXXX account and as a result have reduced my credit limit from {$5000.00} to {$1300.00}. I've tried to explain this, but my credit limit with XXXX hasn't been restored ( since they're using false information ). 

I receive an email from Experian acknowledging the false information and that my report has been updated as of today XX/XX/2021. I am in the middle of refinancing ( being added to a mortgage ) and I need to make sure my credit stays as it was when I applied."
"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",I called for a payoff and the amount was excessive and exceeded the laws of interest in Massachusetts on XX/XX/2021 and will not settle for a reasonable amount I have paid back 3 times the amount of original loan
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",XXXX XXXX XXXXs reporting incorrectly to all three of my credit bureaus. If all of the information comes from the same source why is it reporting differently on all three bureaus. On Experian and XXXX  it has an open date of XX/XX/2019 and on XXXX  its XX/XX/2019. It also shows a credit limit of XXXX on XXXX  and Experian but XXXX  credit limit on XXXX. Being that all of the information reporting isn't correct this needs to be deleted from all three credit bureaus ASAP.
Debt collection,The data that you showed in my credit report I previously requested a proof of how you managed this. You can't demonstrate any of the data referenced in the past credit report information that I challenged with.
Debt collection,I noticed on my credit report that Plaza servic just place a collection from XXXX XXXX XXXX on my credit report. They are not the original creditor. I never received a collection letter for me to dispute this prior for them placing this on my credit file. I mean for them to do this during this pandemic that the hardships is causing everybody is cruel and inhumane. They will try to claim they did send me a letter so it can stay on my credit file or say they can't find me.
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I have been trying to have 3 fraudulent accounts from XXXX deleted from my credit report with Experian for years now ( XXXXXXXX XXXX  account # XXXX ; XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX  account # XXXX ; XXXX XXXX XXXX acct # XXXX ) I have sent numerous letters asking for these accounts be investigated and if verified show proof of their right to post those accounts on my credit reports ( my last letter was report # XXXX on XX/XX/20. ) I have showed indisputable proof from the IRS and Social Security Office that these accounts are not mine. In all cases they have responded with a generic response that the accounts were verified. They verified it without showing how they investigated or proof of their verification, even though i have requested to see this information and its what the law says they must do. Experian continues to violate my rights as a consumer to have an accurate credit file, and must show proof that they have the right to have these fraudulent accounts on my credit reports."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","There are several negative items on my report that I strongly believe are not accurate. I therefore submitted a dispute requesting an investigation and a response into these issues. That dispute was sent out on XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/and I never received any reply. I then sent a follow-up dispute on XX/XX/XXXX. It is now XX/XX/XXXX and I still have absolutely nothing. No investigation was undertaken, no verification was made, and no response was sent. I have a legal right to all these things and the bureaus have a legal responsibility to respond to my disputes."
Debt collection,"On XX/XX/2020 I XXXX XXXX made a phone call to XXXX XXXX XXXX to take care of a debt that I incurred from XXXX XXXX XXXX in the amount of {$850.00}. At the time of speaking with the debt collector they set me up with two seperate payments which was requested by me. On XX/XX/2020 I made a payment of {$420.00} and then of XX/XX/2020 I made the second payment via an auto draft from my bank account of {$420.00}. On XX/XX/2020 when I made the first payment I asked teh debt collector reprsentative that was taking my payment that once I made the final payment would there be something sent to the creditors on my behalf to remove or delete as that was what I requested and they said yes once the final payment had been recieved. They also informed me that they will automatically mail me out a letter stating that it had been paid in full. Once I made the final payment on XXXX XXXX and I did not recieve anything in mail after a week I called the debt collector and asked them why I had not recieved anything in mail and thats when they told me that I had toc all and request that. I explained that the last representative that I spoke with did not tell me that I needed to call in however, she stated that it was something that they automatically did. To my surprise I did not get accurate information. Also, to have it removed or deleted the representative told me that it was something that was available upon request which I did request However, only to find out that this has not been removed or deleted from my credit. The last report showed that it was indeed paid in full but also as an active account which is not the truth. According to my research this is a UDAAP violation when there is Diceptive Acts of Practice which was very misleading for me and an very unnessary process to do the things that I need to do."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Despite several written requests, the unverified bankruptcies listed on my report still remain on my credit report in violation of Federal Law. You are required under the FCRA to have a COPY of the ORIGINAL documentation on file to verify that this information is mine and is correct. Your company have not sent me any documentation that verify the information they are reporting. In the results of your first investigation and subsequent reinvestigation, you stated in writing that you verified that these items are being reported correctly? Your company have said the courthouse verified the public record which is a lie, I contacted the bankruptcy court and I sent a letter directly from the courthouse stating they do not verify with 3rd parties. Which I have attached to this complaint. It is also illegal to report inaccurate information on my report that has not been accurate verified. You have NOT provided me a copy of ANY original documentation ( a consumer contract with my signature on it ) as required under Section 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) & Section 611 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ). Furthermore you have failed to provide the method of verification as required under Section 611 ( a ) ( 7 ). Please be advised that under Section 611 ( 5 ) ( A ) of the FCRA you are required to promptly DELETE all information which can not be verified. The law is very clear as to the Civil liability and the remedy available to me ( Section 616 & 617 ). Your company have failed to comply with Federal Law.

Debt collectors are prohibited from deceiving or misleading you while trying to collect a debt. Debt collectors are generally prohibited under federal law from using any false, deceptive, or misleading misrepresentation in collecting a debt. 

I was deceived by XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX to collect the debt. I am requesting that XXXX XXXX XXXX either remove the account completely from all 3 major credit bureaus or refund the {$900.00} that they lied to collect. 

I have filed several disputes to XXXX XXXX XXXX and they refused to respond to my request.

I was a member. When they went out of business I canceled my membership and canceled my reoccurring payment with my credit card company. 
After they were out of business, XXXX XXXX, another health club took over the facility.

Debt collection,I have been dealing with the defamation of my consumer credit report and the cruel abuse of my reputation. Credit Control Corporation has violated my privacy and has continuously done so sense XXXX/2018. This has taken a major effect on me and my family because I could not extend myself credit pursuant to my open ended consumer credit plan. This alleged debt is not owed by me and is in fact medical information that should be excluded from a consumer credit report 15 USC 1681a ( 3 ) ( A ). This advertisement of a sale of debt is fact coercing payment of debt 15 USC 1692d ( 4 ). Which leads into the violation of 15 USC 1692e ( 10 ) - Deceptive means to collect or attempt to collect a debt.

I am still unemployed so i tried again and was declined. I asked for additional information and none was provided. I continued to request that my concern be escalated. It took at least ( 6 ) phone calls to get someone to take me seriously. 

I never got a call from the escalation team. Three weeks later i got an email. They stated it was an internal issue as to why I was denied twice. I have paid my account on time and tried to keep up with my credit card debt. They offered me XXXX XXXX XXXX miles. That is not enough to buy a ticket one way. 

I am unemployed over 6 months and the offer miles, I did not get the opportunity that other customers in my position received. Citibank did not even care enough about me and what is going on in my life."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I signed up for a 12 month interest free store credit card through XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX to purchase a pair of diamond earrings.

Credit card or prepaid card,Aspire calls 3-4 times per day or until i answer the phone. This is harassment. I have XXXX XXXXXXXX  and this is making me have XXXX XXXX. I want compensation for harassment.
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","On XX/XX/2021, I received a letter from Experian showing that they were unable to honor my request because I did not provide them sufficient information. However, I sent them all the supporting documents that are required in order to submit a dispute. According to the response from the last complaint I submitted, they asked for verification of my identity to To process my dispute. I am exasperated because I have tried to resolve this on many occasions, and it is apparent that they are neglecting my request. The account, XXXX XXXX XXXX, is being negatively reported and STILL contains miss leading information. Attached are the documents that I sent them which include my current proof of address and identification."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","XXXX has been reporting incorrect payment history to all three credit bureaus. My loan and been in deferment and forbearance all of 2020 until now, but the mortgage company is reporting me being 60+ days late to all three bureaus. I have called them in and I have sent them a letter in XX/XX/2020 asking them to correct my payment history. I can not be late if there haven't been any payments due. 

They are violating the rules of the FCRA, the CARES ACT, and the Fair billing act by reporting incorrect payment history to XXXX XXXX  and XXXX Each bureau is reporting different payment information because XXXX  refuses to fix their reporting. 

I have included my letter to them requesting that they correct the payment history, the forbearance letter from them, and a copy of my credit report showing the incorrect payment history."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","There was an inquiry on my Experian credit report from XX/XX/2020, that was a result of identity theft. I discovered this during a review of my credit report. I called Experian and they told me to contact the reporting company. I immediately put a freeze on my credit reports. I called XXXX who made the inquiry and was told that the inquiry was from XXXX XXXX. I spoke to the dealership manager who told me about the applicant who applied for the credit. I verified my information and proved it was not me who applied for the credit. I spoke to XXXX and was told to file a police report and a report with Identitytheft.gov. I did both of these and emailed them the reports asking them to remove the inquiry from my credit report. 

When I spoke to XXXX at XXXX today, she told me that they now require me to send them a copy of my social security number, my driver 's license, and a copy of a utility bill. I told her that they never requested that information before and asked her if I sent them the additional documents if they would immediately remove the inquiry from my report and she was not able to guarantee me that they would. I told her that the information they are requesting is very sensitive and I do not feel comfortable releasing this information to a company that has not been authorized to receive this information and they could use it to further steal my identity now that they have a copy of my social security card, driver 's license, and utility bill. How can I be sure that they are not part of the identity theft scam? 

In essence, I told her that they are re-victimizing me by refusing to remove a fraudulent inquiry in spite of proof from a police report which they requested."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",The account was ordered out of my name and not my responsibility and they refuse to remove and is damaging my credit and making me unable to make purchases. It is not my account it is fraud and court ordered.
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Experian, XXXX and XXXX are showing an account for XXXX that is past the date of them reporting this so this is a violation of the Statute of Limitations and this is a violation of my rights under the FCRA and is actually a civil crime. I am requesting that all 3 credit bureaus remove this old outdated item from my credit reports immediately.

Debt collection,On XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from Aargon collection agency asking to pay a debt in the amount of {$39.00} and interest {$4.00} on the behalf of a creditor XX/XX/XXXX XXXX Hawaii XXXX. They also state that my account is or may be reported to credit reporting agency. I called the collection agency right away. The told this debt is from services received on XX/XX/XXXX. As a matter of fact I have never been on Hawaii at this period of time. I lived in California. I received some services from XXXXXX/XX/XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and paid them on XX/XX/XXXX.
Credit card or prepaid card,"On or about XX/XX/2020 we made a reservation for a XXXX in XXXX, XXXX and paid a deposit of XXXX to reserve the place which was going to be used to celebrate my XXXX birthday on XXXX XXXX. 
Then XXXX happened and we could not travel. We disputed the charge with my credit card company ( Barclays Credit Card Account # XXXX ) and the bank said that they could not dispute this amount because the merchant had no refund or cancellation policy that dealt with XXXX. 
While I understand that the merchant had a no refund cancellation policy that dealt with XXXX, I would like to appeal the rejection of this dispute on the grounds of extreme unforeseen circumstances, since no one really could predict this pandemic and no company was having a clause for this item back in XXXX when I booked the place. 
Given the current pandemic, there is no way we will be able to travel to XXXX for the foreseeable future. We have contacted the merchant on several occasions and were informed we would have a year to claim our credit. This seems extremely unfair and a breach of the original contract, considering that there is no telling when we will be able to travel in the near future, let alone to an international destination, that is currently devastated by an ongoing and uncontrolled pandemic. As you may know, Mexico has seen an increasing rise of COVID cases totaling around 408,499 confirmed, with some experts estimating the real figures closer to 7 million, given testing limitations. It is unreasonable to expect anyone to travel to this destination safely within a years time and therefore we will not be able to claim our credit and forfeit the full amount of our deposit. 
We sent a letter appealing the credit card company decision on XX/XX/2020 and Barclays Bank has not responded or resolved this issue."
Credit card or prepaid card,"On XXXX XX/XX/2020, I purchased a TV ( speakers, mount, cable ) set from Best Buy in XXXX XXXX North Dakota and ask that it be delivered to my house. Before the delivery could happen, I am an elderly woman and I started getting nervous about COVID ( and people in my house ). I called Best Buy and was put on a very lengthy and convoluted hold pattern ... .I eventually talked to someone who was scheduled to be part of the delivery team ( sorry I don't know the name ). He apologized about the customer service line and canceled my order. 

When my next bill came out, I noticed that they had charged me for the TV set that was not delivered. I called. Waited on line forever and was told to write a letter to Best Buy Credit Services. I did. They sent back a letter on XX/XX/2020 saying that they were investigating my claim. When I do talk to someone they say to continue to pay the bill. 

About every week I call and nothing has changed. EXCEPT now they are telling me this is a "" new '' case and they have 90 days to resolve it. I have bought a lot of stuff from Best Buy ... ..and have had it delivered. If they delivered this TV I would like to know the names of the people that delivered it. I would like to see my name where I signed for delivery. I would like to have the Sereil number of the TV set. 

It was not delivered and should not be on my bill. If you need to have copies of the receipt or the bill or anything else please contact me. Thank You"

Mortgage,"For approximately a {$500000.00} loan, which had both statutory and loan provision arrangements for restructuring, the bank reported unnecessary and harmful reports that it did not have to make to damage credit. It then reclassified borrower into a customer tier that prevents refinancing of the loan, that other customers can do. It then failed to update credit reports that all obligations of customer were in conformity with loan provisions or statutory provisions and instead reported and continued to report delinquent. The loan was also fully cured. The report and treatment and exclusion from products the bank has in place now for other customers with similar properties continues to be denied and extract some {$2000.00} per month in punitive improper interest. This rate penalty and product exclusion have been ongoing for at least two years and continues without redress. The report limits alternatives to this lender."

I demand that these accounts be deleted immediately or I will file for litigation due to the stress you have caused me."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",I was just looking over my credit report and found some inaccuracies that I am demanding you correct. This account is paid in full and the creditor agreed to delete the account.
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Since XX/XX/XXXX and most recently XX/XX/XXXX, Experian has failed multiple times to provide me with the results of their investigation after I asked them to validate the debt with the creditor as they are NOT mine. To this date, they ( Experian ) have used several tactics inclusive of asking me to send them proof that I am who I say I am and accusing me of being a third party to my own information. However, I AM the consumer, and I have sent copies of my DL and SS card multiple times to them. I also feel that Experian is utilizing this practice to circumvent and distract me from the fact the creditors were unable to verify the debt because they are not mine,"
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I have a few addresses on my credit report that do not belong to me and I have issues with my verifications for my job. I really need these addresses off my file please delete remove the following:XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX , OH XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, OH XXXX"
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","XXXX XXXX should not be reporting late to XXXX  ; Experian and XXXX  on the XXXX  XXXX  partial account number XXXX. ( Please see page attached from my credit report. ) I called XXXX to change the payment due date. The representative assured me that this was noted in my account. They continue to report this account late even though I make timely payments and have never missed a payment. This has been going on for years and I have called XXXX on numerous occasions and they have verified the new due date however, this account continues to report my payments as lates. This false reporting is seriously harming my credit score. It is a violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act not to report accurate information on a credit report. These lates need to be removed. I have contacted XXXX  as well as the bureaus to fix this, but I have not been successful."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Credit Collection Service is reporting an account from XXXX XXXX that is not mine. This is the same account that they were recently reporting on my dad 's credit report with the same account number, same balance, same open date, same last active date, etc. All information is the same. This account is not mine. The company can not move an account from one person to another person. Note, my dad and I have the same name. However, the suffix at the end of our name is different and all other identifying information such as SSN and date of birth are different. This company needs to get their records straight or be sued!"
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I had sent letters to all three credit bureaus on XX/XX/2020 advising them they have some incorrect account info and needed to delete it via a 609 dispute letter. 

After 30 days of no correspondence from any party I had sent a sceond 30-day demand to comply letter to each bureau letting them know it has been over 30 days from the first letter and for any inaccurate info to be deleted. 

I had sent certified mail so I know they have my demand to comply letter I have not been contacted and nothing has been corrected. I know need your help. 

Enclosed are the copies of each letter to the beraus. Let me know if you need any more info"
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I have a major credit card with XXXX Mastercard. Recently XX/XX/2021 I entered into an agreement with them for 6 months with this card. The agreement is to pay {$50.00} per month at an interest rate of 5.9 % for the 6 months. I was told on XX/XX/2021 that I need to make the first inital payment of {$50.00} which I did with the rep. Going forward I also agreed to have the payments come out of my account each month. I confirmed that the account would be considered in good standing and current. I was assured "" yes ''. On XX/XX/2021 I received a text that the account is past due. I immediately called XXXX mastercard and was told that I need to make another {$20.00} payment. I made the {$20.00} payment. I asked why is the account reporting now as late when I was assured after I made the {$50.00} payment the account would be considered current. I would have paid the {$70.00} if that is what they were requiring to go into this program on that day instead of the account showing as late. I am upset at the fact that I might be charged a late fee and in addition that it's going to be reported to the credit reporting agency 's again. I have been disputing with them about 2 negative remarks that are already reporting when in fact I went through this with them back in XXXX when the pandemic hit."
Debt collection,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a notice of assignment to collection agency from Professional Account Management , LLC for {$50.00}. This is for administrative fee assessed by the New Jersey XXXX XXXX. 
Due to COVID-19, the toll plazas were closed and signs on the highway instructing drivers that tolls will be sent by mail. I have received my toll bills in mid-XXXX XXXX ( on or around XX/XX/XXXX ). I paid my toll bill online and disputed the administrative fee through their website. 
I received an email receipt for the toll payment with a note that my dispute of the administrative fees ( {$100.00}, originally round trip ) will be reviewed and I will be notified. I have never heard back by email or otherwise from the New Jersey XXXX XXXX until the collection letter from XXXX, XXXX sent to me on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I have attempted to dispute the collection with XXXX to no avail, called multiple times and it was clear that they can not be reached by phone by design. I have tried to work through the XXXX  of XXXX to get their attention and have someone reached me by phone, and they were more interested in blaming me than honestly attempt to reach me. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent them a letter to dispute the charges and try to find a solution and I have yet to hear from them. They denied receiving any communication from me even though I attached a copy of the letter I sent them, which does not give me confidence that they are dealing with me with honesty and fairness. I am disputing the {$50.00} charge because I was not at fault when the New Jersey XXXX XXXX fails to send me the toll bills on time. Ultimately, I paid my toll bills but I will not give them the pleasure of acquiescing to them trying to collect through a collection agency. I was never, ever received any mail from a collection agency because I pay my bills, and my excellent credit score proves it. I simply dont want XXXX to damage it."
Debt collection,"I have tried numerous times to talk to someone at XXXX XXXX about an auto debt that I paid off last year, on XX/XX/2020. If and when I actually get to talk to someone about my account, they say they cant help me. It was sent to a collections agency Messerli & Kramer PA. I had set up payments with them on behalf of XXXX XXXX to resolve this debt and it was paid in full. Messerli & Kramer said they notified XXXX that the debt was taken care of. Ally will not only update with the credit Bureaus that the account was settled and that there is a XXXX  balance. They are alleging I now owe another {$10000.00} 's. Which is the amount that was already paid. My credit score is dropping so far down, because they refuse to change my status. One of there representatives told me to file disputes, which I have done numerous times with no resolve. I have documents, and receipts with proof of payments made. I am not sure what else to do at this point. This derogatory remark is ruining me and my families ability to apply for any type of loans. During these difficult times."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","On XX/XX/XXXX, I called XXXX XXXX to request a downgrade of my XXXX  XXXX XX/XX/XXXX card as I was no longer interested in paying the {$170.00} annual fee. I didn't think the fee justified the cards benefit. The representative presented various credit cards I could downgrade to that did not have an annual fee. After a 90-minute conversation, I decided to downgrade to the lower tier of the XX/XX/XXXX card that did not the annual key. I also allowed the representative to charge my checking account for the annual fee of {$170.00} in case the downgrade process takes long in order to avoid being charge a late fee since the annual fee was due. The representative ensured me everything be process and I will receive the new card in a few weeks. 

In the first half of XXXX, I spent a lot of times traveling which was extended due to the pandemic. I was in the west coast until XX/XX/XXXX. When I returned home in XXXX, I found several letters from XXXX XXXX stating that I owed them {$170.00} plus late fees/interest. Also, my credit report was flagged for missed payment. At first, I was confused and thought maybe someone stole the new card while I was away and used it. Because I know that I didn't owe XXXX XXXX anything especially since I paid them the {$170.00} annual fee back in XXXX to avoid any issues relating to downgrading my card. 

After having several conversations with XXXX XXXX bank tellers and two Case Specialist in the XXXX XXXX XXXX Complaints Management Office, they confirmed that the representative did not downgrade the card as he ensured me, he will do. Furthermore, they confirmed that they did receive my payment for the annual fee back in XXXX but failed to update my account with the new balance ( which was {$0.00} ) which resulted in them reporting me to the credit bureau. To explain, XXXX XXXX continued to charge me for the annual fee even though I had already paid them the fee. Every month from XXXX to XXXX they reported a missed payment to all three credit bureaus. They apologized for their mistake and ensure me that they will contact the credit bureau to remove all the negative marks they put on my account as this was their negligence for not verifying their information about my account. It is now XX/XX/XXXX ( I spoke to them XXXX XXXX ) and the missed payment has not been removed. I also open a dispute with Experian and Experian said they refuse to remove it. It seems like the only thing left to do is to take them to court because they are violating the federal fair credit reporting act ( FCRA ) and has damaged my creditworthiness."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Almost every day, a collections agency keeps reporting the same wrong collections to Experian and several other agencies they are allowing this company to report the same wrong issue and therefore my FICO credit score takes hits. I am trying to open disputes but theyre closed and they side with the aggressive power XXXX XXXX XXXX which is known for their bad behavior ( your agency has sue them numerous times ) this company will not return my attorneys or my letters or calls to rectify and they are illegally violating my rights pursuant to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. 1681. This company wont produce the documents to verify these collections."
Mortgage,Bank of America sent a letter to me that they had put my home into foreclosure after i explained to them that i had been laid off permanently from my jobXX/XX/2020 due to Covid19 and i needed forbearance. This is in direct violation of the CARES ACT.
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",I asked the company what was their method of verification on an inaccuracy that I found on my report. The company stated that they verified the information from the US Court. This is a lie because I have written proof that the bureaus never verified with the US Court. This is a violation of my consumer rights and I am requesting it be removed along with any accounts associated with this inaccuracy.
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","During the COVID pandemic I applied for XXXX XXXX Mortgage Deferment Program due to the financial uncertainty that may have followed. My first question to the XXXX XXXX Loan Advisor handling COVID related clams was : "" Will this program affect my credit scores in the present or future? XXXX XXXX 's response was "" No it will not affect the account holders credit scores. 
This is a VA federally backed loan that has been current since XXXX with no missed payments for the record. Fast forward to XX/XX/XXXX when my forbearance was terminated and my account is in good standing with XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX has added the comment to all three Credit Bureaus "" that the account holders are Paying under a partial or modified payment agreement '' On XXXX XX/XX/XXXX my Expirien credit score dropped 82pts due to this comment.

The thing is they had said all along they would put this {$19000.00} at the end of my loan and they totally changed the rules and I will lose my house. I entered this program so they would balloon my payments to the back of the loan. And now I'm in the situation above. 
This is predatory and the lender is trying to get me to possibly do some sort of modification by bumping up my payment so I am hurt and can't make my payments"

I have spoke with them several times since XX/XX/2020 and they refuse to remove the account on my credit report. I have disputed this with each of the credit bureaus directly and have recently requested by mail that they remove the account and have disputed their actions as well.

So basically Ive been supporting a family of 5 by myself. I had advised Flagship and they were aware of the situation. In late XXXX I made a full payment. 
Theyd offered me an extension. When I called back in XXXX to verify it still hadnt been approved.

Mortgage,"I submitted a payoff statement for a second mortgage that was attached to my home XX/XX/2020. Upon receipt of the funds, the mortgage company informed me they would be releasing the lien associated with that second mortgage ( see payoff statement.eml ). 

My new mortgage company scheduled a title signing date ( XX/XX/2020 ) for the new mortgage based upon this information. On XX/XX/XXXX, the Title company reached out to inform the new mortgage company that the second lien had not yet been released ( see attached email Title Signing.eml ) I called multiple times in XXXX ( according to my outbound call history, XXXX, XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX ) inquiring as to why this lien was not released, but nobody was able to identify that it was not released until the XX/XX/XXXX call. At that time a rush order was placed to get the lien released, and it was released by XXXX. 

During this time, I was continuously being charged for my existing mortgage for XXXX a month. Given the dates, the mortgage extended two months beyond where it should have, as this was the only blocker from us signing with Title on XX/XX/2020."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, GA XXXX ] Account Number : # XXXX XX/XX/XXXX To Whom It May Concern : Thank you for taking the time to read this letter. I am writing because I noticed that my most recent credit report contains late payments reported on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX for my Wells Fargo account. 

I want you to know that I understand my financial obligations, and if it were not for divorce expenses, I would have an excellent repayment record. I made a mistake in falling behind, but since then, I have changed careers with higher wages, the divorce proceeding are done and I no longer have the vehicle that was financed through WFDS. 

I am planning to apply for a mortgage within the next year, and its come to my attention that the missed payment on my record could hurt my ability to qualify. I truly believe that it does not reflect my creditworthiness and commitment to repaying my debts. It would help me immensely if you could give me a second chance and make a goodwill adjustment to remove the late payment on XXXX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. 

Thank you for your consideration, and I hope you will approve my request. 

Best, XXXX XXXX"

Either way, I have not received ANY response to my disputes. Please send my updated credit reports!"
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Transunion has blatantly disregarded my dispute letter from over 45 days ago. The fair Credit Reporting Act allows for a timely investigation of any disputed account on my consumer report. Your company has failed to adhere to federal law and has broken the law. The only way to avoid any more liability for your company is to take the requested action below.

Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted Barclaycard to dispute several late fee assessments on my account and their failure to reply to email and written disputes of said amounts on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. My account due date is the XXXX of each month and the fees that I'm disputing are characterized as late fees : XX/XX/XXXX ( {$40.00} XXXX despite payments : XX/XX/XXXX of {$300.00}, XX/XX/XXXX of {$100.00} and XX/XX/XXXX of {$160.00} ; XX/XX/XXXX ( {$29.00} XXXX despite payments of : XX/XX/XXXX of {$170.00}, XX/XX/XXXX of {$100.00} and XX/XX/XXXX of {$100.00} ; XX/XX/XXXX ( {$29.00} XXXX despite payments of : XX/XX/XXXX of {$200.00}. 

I spoke with representative XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, as the phone lines were closed the majority of the year due to COVID and I had been unable to reach anyone by phone, email or letter until this date. XXXX advised that Barclays closes their billing cycle on the XXXX of every month and as such will apply any payments made prior to the XXXX to the prior month 's billing. I advised that I make payments exclusively online through my In Home Support Services worker because I am disabled and pay someone to come in to handle my legal affairs at the beginning and end of each month. At no point in time did the website indicate that payments made on that day would not apply to the monthly payment. In fact, the minimum payment for the month showing as owing is always listed and gives the account holder the belief that it is being paid. 

I asked XXXX to transfer my call to manager XXXX XXXX XXXX, as I disagreed with their policy of assessing late fees for timely payments without providing any type of notice, as well as their failure to answer emails and written complaints regarding previous late fees, as I would've been apprised of their policy had they responded to my earlier disputes. 

XXXX refused to apply the payment that I made today for {$77.00} to my XX/XX/XXXX due date despite the fact that I told her that the payment was made online XX/XX/XXXX for my XX/XX/XXXX due date and that COVID has left me unable to make additional payments. Additionally, she refused to refund any late fees from XXXX despite their failure to respond to my previous disputes and only promised to provide a credit for the {$40.00} late fee assessed on XX/XX/XXXX in a future billing cycle. 

In most months, I make between 2-3 payments to help pay off my card sooner. At no time did their website alert me to the fact that my payments were not being recorded appropriately and they never responded to my inquiries to clarify their policies to allow me to make any changes."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Express Recovery is reporting erroneous collections on my credit file. I have been checking on my credit and noticed that Express Recovery is reporting paid collections. When I first settled these collections they assured me that the account would be removed. However, it's been over 4 months and they are still reporting. Not only that, these accounts are all medical bills! I never signed a HIPPA patient release form allowing them to report on my credit file. This is a HIPPA violation and must be removed from my credit immediately. The debt is no longer owed & you are in violation."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",XXXX XXXX is reporting incorrectly to all three of my credit bureaus. If all of the information comes from the same source why is it reporting differently on all three bureaus. On XXXX  and XXXX it has an open date of XX/XX/2019 and on Transunion its XX/XX/2019. It also shows a credit limit of XXXX on Transunion and XXXX but XXXX credit limit on XXXX. Being that all of the information reporting isn't correct this needs to be deleted from all three credit bureaus ASAP.

I asked that this account be removed from my reports as it could obviously not be verified. I have submitted disputes multiple times with each credit bureau and they all respond that the information is correct in less than 7 days. This is an impossibility!!!! 

This account needs to be removed from my account according to the FCRA Section 604, 609 and 611. They can not positively verify this account.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",This account was opened without my consent by my ex. I only found out it was in my name after legally separating. My ex missed a payments and later totaled the vehicle. I was left to settle and pay on the account off and legally go after my ex for the funds paid. I have yet to recoup my funds and on top of that XXXX XXXX does not have the original documents signed in my name nor does it have records of the last payment I made to close the account on XX/XX/20. I have the receipt to prove I paid it yet they have no record on file when I call. Ive talked to various managers and always the same answer. They will not take this account off of my credit report even though I did not open it and they can not produce Proof of Ownership with my signature on it.
Checking or savings account,"I own a vacation rental property and a man named XXXX XXXX reached out to to me through XXXX and wanted to rent my vacation home. He said his company was paying so he needed to send a check. When I received the check ( from XXXX XXXX, XXXX in XXXX, TN on a Bank of America check ) it was for more than he owed and he asked me to XXXX the difference once the check clears. I electronic deposited it to my checking account at Bank of America, it showed cleared later that day and I sent the difference of {$2200.00} via XXXX to XXXX XXXX at email XXXX, which was also a Bank of America account. A few days later, XXXX said he had to cancel the reservation because his wife got XXXX and asked if I could refund the rest. I sent the remaining {$2200.00} to XXXX XXXX via XXXX at email XXXX which was a XXXX account I think. Several days later, I got a letter in the mail from my bank, Bank of America, notifying me that the original check was fraudulent. I immediately called Bank of America to notify them of entirety of the fraud however, the funds could not be recovered from the XXXX accounts as the accounts had been closed. I feel like Bank of America had multiple opportunities to protect me during this and failed to do so. They should not have allowed me to initially deposit a fraudulent check, it, especially because this was a Bank of America check. Once they were unable to retrieve the funds from the check, they should have notified me in a more timely and urgent manner ( i.e. a phone call, email text message ) than through the mail, which would have prevented me from dispersing those funds through XXXX. Furthermore, one of the accounts that I send the fraudulent funds to was another Bank of America account which gave Bank of America ample opportunity to recognize the fraud/crime and intervene to protect me. I recently met with two agents from the Department of Homeland Security because XXXX XXXX was involved with another fraud case they were investigating and they said that Bank of America should have done more to protect me and should reimburse me the {$3900.00} I have lost."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","When I filed a second dispute of a charge-off that Ally Financial placed on my credit report, the company updated information in my credit file to alter the date that they first reported the charge-off illegally, in order to re-age the entry and sell it to a debt collector. 
I initially disputed the charge-off that Ally first reported in XXXX of XXXX as I was a victim of Hurricane Harvey in XXXX, TX. In XXXX of XXXX when my lease ended, Ally did not remove the fees that were supposed to be dismissed due to my status as a person affected by Hurricane Harvey. Ally began reporting charge-offs to my credit file from XX/XX/XXXX though XXXX of XXXX.

I called XXXX XXXX to find out where my escrow was and they said they had paid the escrow and was still waiting on the final check from Freedom. XXXX XXXX is a wonderful company I wish I could go back to. All my fellow veterans steer clear of Freedom Mortgage. Freedom would not return their calls or mine. This was during XXXX. XXXX XXXX was about to wire them their check back. We both were not getting our calls returned. They finally paid them to satisfy the loan. 

I found out from my previous mortgage company that they had already paid the taxes in the amount of XXXX. My loan amount should of been l XXXX. So after spending the month of XXXX trying to find out where the XXXX was with numerous phone calls I still do not have a resolution. They have now revised the closing disclosure saying that XXXX is being put in an escrow analysis and they will let me know next week what they decide. I didn't even see the first closing disclosure until the day of closing. 

What needs to be done. 

You have collected the escrow of 8 months and the cushion. The closing disclosure should be revised to reflect the correct loan amount. It should be XXXX. The money should not be put in escrow. I am writing this letter to complain because I know this company has taken advantage of me."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","On XX/XX/2021 at XXXX I disputed incorrect reporting on my credit report with Experian .

I spoke to someone who's name is XXXX that the dispute remains, while speaking with him I ask for the name and number of the person who his company spoke with, I was told we didn't speak to anyone its was done internally. 
I said how could your company investigate something without speaking to the other company to verify the information is correct and was told that's how its done. 
Experian is committing fraud and lying to the public by taking such action. 
I have a letter from one of my creditors that the incorrect information would be removed. 
I would like for CFPB to have Experian have all of my disputes deleted from my credit report. 
This inaccurate information is causing me harm and stress.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I received a letter from Citibank informing me that they had downgraded my credit card from an {$8600.00} Credit Line and {$2000.00} Cash Advance Line to a {$1000.00} Credit Line and {$0.00} Cash Advance, on my CitiBusiness AaAdvantage credit card. 

The letter stated that Citibank received a credit score from XXXX  for me of XXXX, which they used to make this decision. However, when I logged into my "" XXXX  '' account, I found that my Credit score was XXXX ( Excellent Credit ), which is the credit rating that I believe I always had. 

Citibank sends periodic "" Soft Inquiry '' requests to XXXX to insure that my credit rating has not changed. I believe that Citibank somehow either received an erroneous response to their last Soft Inquiry from XXXX, or that CitiBank had some processing issue and did not process the XXXX report properly. 

I can not get either CitiXXXX or XXXX to provide me with a copy of the Soft Inquiry in question. CitiXXXX refuses to re-instate my previous credit line, even though I have excellent credit and my current credit rating as of XX/XX/2021 is XXXX on XXXX. Citibank suggests I should dispute the credit report that they received from XXXX, but they will not provide me with the report that caused them to downgrade my credit. Since my credit rating/report/score on XXXX is near perfect, I don't have any cause to dispute information on their website, or with the credit report that they provide to me directly.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I have a DISMISSED Bankruptcy that was filed in XXXX and is almost at the 10 year mark ; I have disputed it with the bureaus trying to get it removed prior to the 10 years, especially since it's dismissed and doesn't legally exist any longer and can only be verified through public record. My first dispute with the bureaus was on XX/XX/XXXX followed by a 2nd dispute on XX/XX/XXXX."

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I purchased a new car from XXXX XXXX XXXX of XXXX, NJ in XXXX XXXX. Approximately one month after the purchase I discovered an issue. When purchasing the vehicle XXXX XXXX input the incorrect contact information on my account. The social security number, DOB, etc. on the account does not match mine. For this reason I am unable to access any online services for this loan, including my account number, online payment, and most importantly auto-pay. My only way to pay XXXX/XXXX was to pay over the phone when they called me. They didn't call in XXXX, I can only assume this was due to COVID. I contacted XXXX/XXXX on multiple occasions but they were never able to fix the issue. 

In XXXX of XXXX I realized that XXXX XXXX were reporting a late payment on my account from XX/XX/XXXX. At that time I attempted to reach-out to XXXX XXXX via phone at least 5 times to address the reported late payment. I was told by the front line customer service reps that there was nothing they could do to resolve the reported late payment, despite the incorrect information on my account, and that a manager would call me back. The managers called at times when I was unavailable, so I returned their calls leaving voicemails each time. I never received additional follow-up from them. 

In addition to calls directly to XXXX XXXX, I've sent them a letter outlining the situation and asking them to change their credit bureau reporting. I've also reported the error through the credit bureau dispute processes. Unfortunately, none of these efforts have led to resolution of this issue. 

XXXX XXXX 's inaccurate reporting is significantly negatively impacting my life. Tonight I attempted to finance a new cell phone ( only a {$1000.00} purchase ) and was denied by two different banks. If this one late payment were removed from my account XXXX XXXX estimates my credit score increases from XXXX to the XXXX range. This late payment seems to be the only reason for denial of my credit applications. 

Thanks in advance for your help!"

I also requested specifically what method of validation did the credit bureaus receive to determine the debt was valid.I requested the credit reporting agency provide copies of whatever information the collection agency provided to validate this debt and if the documentation could not be provided, I respectfully requested for the item to be removed from my credit report. As of today, XX/XX/XXXX, I have not received any of the requested information and the debt is still reporting negatively on my credit.

I've disputed this with XXXX  in XX/XX/XXXX, the collections agency ( Southwest Recovery ) in XX/XX/XXXX, and now recently directly with the property management company XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. This was clearly a bad business practice that their account manager, XXXX XXXX admits. She said the policy was changed as a result of many of these types of mishaps and they now require both signatures. According to Sec 94.053 both tenant and landlord must sign the lease and in Sec 94.055 it states if you they don't receive any communication from the tenant, then the renewal could be modified if the tenant remains on the property. Their renewal even states that the renewal must be signed by the tenant. If I was the tenant, then why was I not required to sign it?

Frustrated, I uploaded documents showing that I had sent correspondence to Amsher through their online portal, through e-mail, and through physical US mail requesting debt validation. Experian ignored the fact that XXXX refuses to respond to my requests for debt validation, they also refuse to acknowledge that XXXX violated my FCRA rights by giving me no notice of this debt, at all, in any form, and have decided that this account should remain on my credit report.

Experian requires a PIN to lock credit, but I do not have a PIN, and every time I try to search for the mechanism by which I can get a PIN issued ( or reissued? ), it sends me in a circle. Meanwhile, my credit report with them is unlocked, and my credit is unprotected! 

If credit reporting were the responsibility of the US government, and the government did as poor of a job as Experian, people would be up in arms. I have no idea why this absolute cabal of extortionary gangsters have so much power in our financial system."

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","In XXXX of 2017, I opened a checking account with XXXX XXXX XXXX. In XXXX of 2017, I deposited a check into the account that ended up being drawn on an account that had just been closed, although I did not know it. My account was immediately frozen. I called customer service, and they told me what had happened and suggested that I go speak to the manager of the bank branch where I had opened the account, who should be able to lift the freeze. 

When I went to the bank to see the manager, I was accompanied by my two granddaughters, who are XXXX. The manager stared at them, and it was obvious to me that because he was white, he was making a XXXX judgment on me ( I'm also white ) for having XXXX grandchildren. He was very rude to me and told me that because the deposit I made was returned, it caused several checks I had written to bounce. Although the account was not overdrawn, because I had bounced a check in the first 30 days, he said that bank had to close my account. The manager returned to me the money that was still in the account, and closed it during my visit. He assured me that there would be no negative reporting ramifications from the closure, as it was not my fault. 

Recently, I attempted to open an account with a different bank and was denied. I obtained a copy of my ChexSystems Report ( as recommended by the denying bank ) to see why I had been denied, and I noted that XXXX  XXXX XXXX had reported me to ChexSystems in 2017, indicating they had closed my account due to "" suspected fraud ''. This is completely inaccurate. The ChexSystems report also indicated that I had an unpaid amount owed to XXXX as a result of the closed account, which is also inaccurate. 

I contacted XXXX several times to request that they remove the false information from ChexSystems, but the customer service reps I spoke with said they were unable to do so, but could not provide me any valid reason why ( as they agreed with me as to why my account had been closed and confirmed I did not owe XXXX any money ). 

The false and negative report by XXXX  XXXX XXXX to ChexSystems is preventing me from opening any bank accounts, which I need to do for my small business. I am being harmed severely every day that the false information remains on the report."

On XX/XX/2020, I sent Experian another certified dispute letter with supporting documentation.

After receiving the response from Experian in regard, I sent another letter requesting the items be deleted and enclosed a copy of my social security card, ID with my name and correct address as proof of my identity.

She did not have a balance on the card and it was closed for non-usage. Once she became aware of the closure, less than a week later, my wife and I immediately contacted Barclays where they informed us that it could not be reopened and suggested that she reapply. Barclays stated that one notice was sent informing us of the upcoming card closure, a notice we did not receive. The unreceived notice should not come as a surprise because of the current pandemic, it was at the height of the holiday season coupled with known issues with USPS. Simply reapplying would not be sufficient because my wife loses all the positive history she has built on her credit reports when they hastily closed the card and that can not be regained on a new card. I attempted to contact upper management with limited success via email. I sent emails to XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX with Barclays. I received a response from the Office of the President at Barclays who was overseen by XXXX XXXX. The response indicated that further correspondence would continue through XXXX, which provides mediation software. The email that I used was not compatible for XXXX so I reached out to Ms. XXXX to see if the resolution could simply be sent to another email address of mine.

I then called again at XXXX XXXX EST on XX/XX/2020 and spoke to XXXX - who told me I should seek that refund from XXXX and that is what the system is showing.

They stated that XXXX had my money. 

I attempted to file the complaint via the Barclays bank dispute process. I attached the response from the US Federal Reserve Bank of XXXX XXXX which stated in effect that XXXX was in possession of my money. Barclays stated they reviewed the letter but a letter from the US Federal Reserve was inadequate to reverse a decision in this matter. I am very frustrated with Barclays since this is clearly a fraudulent transaction and if a letter from the Fed is insufficient what level of evidence would be sufficient? 

I spoke to a manager at Barclays named XXXX, who stated that since this was a face to face transaction there was nothing they could - again despite a letter from US Fed ; I am having trouble understanding what gives Barclays the right to ignore the Federal Reserve. 

In the Federal Reserve Complaint it is stated, "" XXXX XXXX concluded its investigation and determined that the gift card balance had already been refunded to XXXX Store # XXXX on XX/XX/2020. We confirmed that the funds have been reversed back to XXXX Store # XXXX, and that you will need to contact the store for resolution.

I never paid partial payments. I deferred three payments to the end of my loan. In addition paid 8 additional payments since loan origination. Because I set up bi-weekly payments. I would also like the months I made payments to reflect those. 
It was my understanding the forbearance would not reflect poorly. If I new it would take 6 months to reinstate / modify my loan I would have repaid the suspended payments. This information was not discussed as we are all in uncharted times. I was working with my financial institution on a new loan and their underwriting flagged the non reporting mortgage payments."

This debt should never have went to collections. The original creditor/collections agency was notified in writing by certified mail that this debt is invalid. 

Experian did not investigate my dispute properly and only updated information, ignoring my supporting documentation which proved this account should have never been sent to collections. This is also a HIPPA violation as my information should have never been shared with an outside party."

First, credit freezes do not appear on the Experian site and theres no way to search. I finally found freeze options when I clicked on a product they sell credit lock. On that page, in very small letters, they explain that a credit lock is different than a freeze. Clicking on the freeze takes you to an application which doesnt function properly. It keeps telling me I havent filled in my old addresses when there are no blanks for this information. 

The phone system also doesnt work. It only gives you options to unfreeze but not freeze your credit reports. 

Ive been trying without luck to get a person on the phone or via chat.

To this day over 120 days later, and that was the only letter I received. I also sent them an Affidavit about the violations. I feel like I'm being taken advantage of and being ignored of my disputes. Section 611 ( a ), it plainly stated that a failure to investigate these items within 30 days gives a reason to immediately remove these items from my credit report it has been over 120 days so they should be deleted promptly.

Experian said that they MAY have obtained the Bankruptcy information through a third-party vendor, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
How can this Bankruptcy information be certified as accurate when you do not know where you actually obtained it from?

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I have paid my account as agreed but the company keeps reporting an inaccurate information on my account, they marked it as late payments.

We spent the last year and a half attempting to get our stock certificate returned to us to no avail. Loancare would not admit they were not in possession of it and we had to explain on end for hours how a cooperative building worked and that we needed our stock certificate or an affidavit to be provided stating that they were not in possession of ( lost ) it. After having multiple tickets opened up that led nowhere, we finally got the CFPB involved and that deficiency was resolved. 
I am hoping the CFPB can help us again this time as we have tried numerous times to get our lien removed since we resolved the last issue, but it looks like XXXX no longer has record of our account with them ( we've been paid off for over a year and a half now ).

So since I paid for those items with my credit card it should not be reported on my credit report this is a violation 15 U.S. Code 1692g - Validation of debts ( 3 ) a statement that unless the consumer, within thirty days after receipt of the notice, disputes the validity of the debt, or any portion thereof, the debt will be assumed to be valid by the debt collector ; So you assumed this debt is valid even after you have stated that there are inaccuracies in the debt"

I spoke with XXXX again, XXXX - XXXX PST on XX/XX/XXXX and was sent from department to department speaking to representatives in their fraud and customer services department only to be disconnected without resolution. 

I fear this really indicates XXXX 's lack of security protocols and their inability to have any oversight to their credit card billing and management systems. Their lack of knowledge about their own processes is grossly expressed as their representatives appear to be mouthpieces to only drive their customers to give up due to their corporate direction of not really caring about their clients concerns. I am sure that I am not the only one going through this exhaustive process to right the wrong due to their negligence. 

I hope this is enough information to start this investigation.

Checking or savings account,"XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX, at Wells Fargo, is a part of the problem the world is the way it is. 

Well Fargo has an internal policy, that lines up with XXXX XXXX app to purposefully delay the posting to an account to create fees on both sides as they point to one another as the cause. 

I personally don't care to dig through red tampon tape as my business partners bleed me. Like XXXX. 

So, When I called to fix it, they gave me a breakdown of my transactions. As if that's not why I'm calling. 

Then, XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX became hostile. Screaming and yelling, but she is the Consumer Advocate? How? 

Regardless, Wells Fargo explicitly allowed me to enroll on overdraft protection, only to ake sure I overdraft and have to use the protections "" offered. '' Its a ponzi scheme, set in timetables of due dates on wires and funds, and most of the time they target people they know wont fight them on the fee. I'm not that person. 

WF protection program entitled me to up to the date news on my disputes as well as, what I understood in the terms, a good faith promise to investigate a dispute within the wheelhouse of the program. 

Today, XXXX refused to take my fee dispute against XXXX. Initially, she offered to transfer me to claims, then she said she didn't have anyone, then she said she could look into it, then she said what I was looking for, then proceeded to deny ever offering me a chance to speak with claims. It was a runaround. I just got off their recorded line maybe 10 minutes ago. 

Additionally, with regards to the XXXX claim, worth XXXX. The protection program states it will keep you updated on disputes throughout the process. When I submitted the XXXX dispute, on the same day, I submitted an Audible dispute with the exact same claims and underlying basis for the claim. 

Unclear Terms and Conditions. 
I did not sign up for this, based on those terms, I understood x, but they only mentioned y. 

This line of reasoning entitled me to XXXX bucks back from XXXX. 
But from XXXX, it lost out on the same day? Exact same baseline facts? Exact same underlying issues. Except XXXX is up and coming and they don't want to risk it. 

Regardless, you notice the problem with the fact set? I'm only mentioned as the person doing th eleg work to make the protection program, protect me? 

They refused to investigate Refused to update Did not exercise good faith Have inconsistent XXXX or Timetables are weighted towards overdraft Case in point, WF and XXXX are in bed together and consumers are paying for the hotel room."

WF did not communicate limits to this and subsequently removed them from this status resulting in 30-60-90 day late reporting. Again, no limits had been communicated to me or my co-signer, despite me making an additional request in XXXX to extend. 

When I inquired when/why these changes places to place, it took speaking to the XXXX to get an answer that wasn't "" you need to pay these to bring them current ... that's all we know '' and I waited an additional 15 days to be told they had no intention of acknowledging their lack of compassion, communication, or damage to my credit report. In addition to catching them rack fees in my account and being issued a refund for multiple instances of these fee assessments, I believe Wells Fargo is a predatory bank that should be investigated. 

They are resolving themselves of their place in the student debt crisis and selling their student loan accounts to a third party -- leaving thousands of us with loans nearly in default to instead deal with collection agencies where additional fees will be added. 

This is unfair, inaccurate, and it should be examined further to prevent Wells Fargo from further profiting from it's predation."

I can see the account still reporting on XXXX XXXX"
Checking or savings account,"Wells Fargo manipulated my fraud dispute. I had two issues. First, I had recurring payments of {$2.00} that I didn't see. I also had a large purchase which was unauthorized. I called Wells Fargo about the larger unauthorized fraudulent purchase when it had overdrawn my account by about {$200.00}. The representative didn't follow my instructions. She issued a claim for only the three instances of {$2.00}, and due to a loophole of 60-day window for fraud claims, she intentionally omitted the larger, and most recent fraud claim. This was considerably larger and not my purchase. Wells Fargo subsequently refused to refund this larger claim citing the ability to only process 3 unauthorized charges. They then never gave me the money back, expected me to come up with the funds, and since I don't have the money, my account was closed and sent to collections for a fraud purchase I never did."

I recently submitted a request for investigation of an Acct Number : XXXX  XXXX XXXX ( I NEVER OPEN THIS ACCOUNT ) Ive submitted enough information regarding the fraudulent account thats open in my name I have provided information for your company to have carried out a reasonable investigation of this dispute. If you had investigated properly rather then using your e-Oscar system you would have noticed that this account is not mine which your companies have claimed to Verified. Since youve obviously neglected to investigate this account thoroughly I am demanding you remove this account off my profile. It is at this time that I will point out the in Cushman v TransUnion, Stevenson v. TRW ( Experian ), and Richardson v. Fleet, Equifax et, the courts ruled each and every time that the CRA couldnt merely Parrot information from the creditors and collection agencies that they have conduct an independent REASONABLE investigation to ensure the validity of the debt and honesty/integrity of the creditors/CA in question. Sending out a generic form through the e-Oscar system that doesnt even contain my reasons for the dispute is not reasonable. 

If you dont initiate an investigation regarding my dispute, as it is my right under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, I will have to take legal action to protect my credit rating and myself. Which Im sure you are aware each violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act allows damages of {$1000.00} should this matter ends up in court. 
I look forward to an expedite resolution of this matter Thank you.

I was not given the correct information from Bank of America that this program would put my loan into forebarance. I recently tried to refinance my current home and was told I would not be able to for 12 months because of the BOA forebarance. I have tried to work with BOA to get that removed from my credit as I was not informed it was going to affect my credit. I did not need that program and now I am unable to refinance due to being mis-lead."
Mortgage,I have been trying to do my best and try to work with my lender but all they do is give me the run around. I have provided documents to them on a timely manner and have resent several documents over and over again. They continue to advise that they don't have a clear image when I am looking at the document and it's a clear as can be. They now closed my review as of yesterday because of this and have to start all over again because someone in their department is just by passing my documents and not even reviewing them.

The account that they opened a dispute against is a 100 % accurate account. I called Experian and they stated they claimed I contacted them and reported that account as fraud. Which is a complete un-true statement. I contacted them about a fraudXX/XX/XXXX that they have since rectified. However they only acknowledged one of those request and it took 2 times so I believe the confused the two. I was told that since it was opened under fraud it can not be canceled and I have to wait. So I asked for a manager and was not provided one. Experian need to cancel the dispute as I have active accounts withXX/XX/XXXX and this can interfere with them.

Checking or savings account,"THIS IS AN ADDENDUM/CORRECTION TO MY COMPLAINT # XXXX WHICH INDICATED THE WRONG SAVING ACCOUNT #. THE CORRECTED ACCOUNT NUMBER IS REFERENCED IN STEP # 4. 
IN ADDITION, XXXX POLICE REPORT/COMPLAINT # : XXXX was filed XX/XX/21. 
Citibank , N.A . failed to safeguard my funds in my Savings Plus account. My account was hacked on XX/XX/21 ( probably on XX/XX/21 ) as I was able to see the unauthorized ACH debit posted to an unknown account/person ( XXXX ) in the amount of {$19000.00}. 
I was shocked and immediately tried to report the fraud to Citibank and was sent to XXXX representative XXXX ID # : XXXX and explained what I saw and asked to report this as fraud/hacking. After several transfers and was unable to hear clearly I asked for a US representative in the Fraud department. I was told these funds were completely gone and the ACH transferred without any red flag alert, security check or confirmation that this large transfer was never my habit in 39 years of banking with Citibank. They did not transfer money in increments, but in less than overnight-they fully completed this fraudulent transaction. I was asked if I wanted to dispute and then assigned CASE ID # : XXXX. 
It has been my clear pattern and habit to transfer any funds from savings into checking before executing an ACH Debit. They said all that was needed to execute this fraud was my name, routing number and account number. This was very alarming, but they did not seem to want to expedite this matter until I asked to speak to a supervisor. Supervisor XXXX ID # : XXXX then expedited this to Citibank 's PECS Department which is internal, back office and I am not able to contact them directly. I have still not been given provisional credit or return of my funds and they only will say their investigation is "" ongoing '' while I can not use my funds which I need now very much."

I contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and they told me they had dropped the ball and this should of been updated in there system in XXXX which it was not and now they don't have a time grabs of when this information will be updated! This is a violation of my consumer right with incorrect reporting on my credit report and is negativity impacting my credit as well as could prevent me from purchasing my home.
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",on XX/XX/XXXX I submitted a dispute via certified mail to experian noting that inaccurate information was being reported on my credit report.

However, after reviewing my XXXX  Credit report, I discovered that XXXX used a third-party data company. On XX/XX/2020, I sent XXXX  another certified dispute letter with supporting documentation.

After receiving the response from XXXX  in regard, I sent another letter requesting the items be deleted and enclosed a copy of my social security card, ID with my name and correct address as proof of my identity. I received correspondence from XXXX  stating that once again the disputed item was verified-certified. I am convinced at this time, that either they are not conducting their investigation under the laws and guidelines set forth by the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) or they are blowing me off.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Experian is reporting my HELOC loan incorrectly as if it were open and an active revolving credit account. It is actually closed and in the repayment phase. I have a letter from XXXX confirming that it is in fact closed and not active and in a repayment phase. XXXX and XXXX are both reporting this accurately but Experian continues to report it incorrectly as an open revolving credit line. 
It originally had a XXXX limit which was never used fully but when the 10 year term expired There was a total of XXXX spent. This is the figure that Ive been paying back as a 2nd mortgage, not the limit of an active revolving credit account which is what Experian is currently reporting.

Again on XXXX the same thing occurred, my monthly payment was applied as a principle payment. I spoke with a supervisor on XXXX at XXXX and he had asked how I pay. I stated by check and on the check I specifically state monthly payment only, I also included a letter the 2nd time around stating that this is not to be applied to the principle. The supervisor stated well they just bundle to the checks, they don't even look at the checks. They stated that they will have the payment moved. When asking if I have to call and deal with this every month, they refused to answer. So far nothing has been resolved. This has to do with Freedom Mortgage Corp."
Mortgage,"My loan was transferred to this new company a few months ago. I was in an active COVID-19 forbearance plan.

I'm one payment behind because my tenants moved out, but I'm positioned to catch up before the federal COVID-19 protection period ( maximum one full year ) is over ; however, the current loan servicer will only allow me to extend my protection to the end of XXXX. At this point in time, they require me to submit full financial disclosures and go through a full loss mitigation process instead of allowing me the option to extend the full period. I request that this business is reviewed for their predatory practices against individuals protected by the CARES act.

I have requested Transunion and XXXX to assist and review the information for completeness and accuracy. They do nothing but shuffle paper and ask their client XXXX XXXX to verify they are reporting correctly. Sometimes Transunion and XXXX have informed me that XXXX XXXX has mailed a response and feel like they have done their American duty. The response from XXXX XXXX is actually a request for more of my personal information so XXXX XXXX can do a fraud investigation that my personal information was not obtained illegally.
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","In XXXX, I contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to see what options were available so that I would not have my house go into foreclosure. They failed to provide accurate information regarding workout options and foreclosure information. I asked about what options were open for me. They told me that I could not do a loan modification, Deed-in-lieu, Short-sale, or refinance. Different told me different things when I called the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Mortgage department so options were told that they were unavailable to me and then they were, or I was too late because of the misinformation. I hired 3 different estate agents who listed the house. I had 2 people who made offers to buy the property for a percentage but, the bank refused saying that it was not enough. one offer was for {$18000.00} and the other was for {$30000.00}. Agents told me that many people didn't put in offers because the garage that is located near the property did not come with the house. So with no acceptable offers, the property went into foreclosure and in XX/XX/XXXX it was sold for {$24000.00}. The mortgage never included the garage located near the property but, as of XX/XX/XXXX, there was a survey completed showing that the garage is actually part of the property. The garage was never insured and only used 1 stall of the garage being that the other stall was used by the owner of other property, and believed to be owned by the owner of other nearby property that shares driveway next to the property. The power is connected to the other property. The garage was never included on the mortgage or appraisal for the mortgage. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX did not work with me or provide accurate information regarding workout options which have resulted in foreclosure on my credit report and preventing me from getting another home for me and my family."
Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I purchased an excursion for Alaska  through XXXX/XXXX XXXX in the amount of {$450.00}. The transaction shows a date of XX/XX/XXXX. 

I bought insurance for the excursion from XXXX XXXX for {$26.00} on the same date ( XX/XX/XXXX ). The transaction date shows XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I purchased another Alaska excursion through XXXX/XXXX XXXX in the amount of {$230.00}. The transaction date shows XX/XX/XXXX. 

I bought insurance for the excursion from XXXX XXXX for {$13.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. The transaction date shows XX/XX/XXXX. 

Totaling {$730.00} I purchased these excursions in XX/XX/XXXX for my XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX. The cruise was canceled and I rescheduled for XX/XX/XXXX. Instead of receiving a refund, the company said they would honor the two excursions for the XXXX XXXX XXXX 

I then received word from my travel agent in XX/XX/XXXX that XXXX/XXXX XXXX was in financial default and no one would be receiving their money or get their excursions. I was told by my agent to file a claim with the credit card company for a refund due to NOT receiving the services I paid for. I filed a claim by phone on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I received notification that the claim was denied and closed. 

I went inside the bank this time on XX/XX/XXXX, to file another claim. I spoke to an associate who had to file the claim by phone. She explained to the person that I had not received the services for which I paid for and explained to them the business was in financial default under receivership ( State of Wisconsin ). The person told the associate the issue was between me and the merchant. She then reiterated that the business was in financial default. The claims person said they were not responsible for the Government shut down and refunding me the money. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I attempted to file a claim online with Wells Fargo. I can not do so because the online banking is not showing the transactions for those purchases. It shows all my other purchases, but not those mentioned above. I do have them on my XX/XX/XXXX bank statement. 

The debit/VISA credit card used was through Wells Fargo Bank. 

Thank you in advance for your assistance."
Debt collection,"I was notified by the collection agency Aldous & Associates about an alleged debt of {$120.00} from XXXX XXXX. I have reason to believe I do NOT owe this debt because I have not had an account with XXXX XXXX since XX/XX/XXXX when my contract for the year of XXXX ended. Furthermore, gyms were closed for the majority of the year of XXXX due to COVID per the Governor order. How can one be charged for serviced not rendered. It is highly dishonest and highway robbery. 
I would like to reiterate that I do NOT owe this debt and, attached is the proof : an email from XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX admitting to me that they have made an error and, that I do not have any account that is past due or that at risk of being sent to collections. I have printed and sent the email to the collection agency by certified mail but, for some reason they have decided to act obtuse to the proof."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I HAVE DISPUTED THIS DEBT MULTIPLE TIMES BUT EXPERIAN IT IS STILL SHOWING ON MY CREDIT REPORT STATING THAT I LIVED AT : XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, CA. 

I HAVE ATTACHED A LETTER ALONG WITH EVIDENCE THAT ADDRESS DOES NOT EXIST."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Experian is reporting a debt on my credit report, from a company named XXXX XXXX  XXXX for {$400.00}. This debt does not belong to me. I have no knowledge of this debt. It is fraud. Experian is aware of my stolen identity. I reported to Experian that my identity had been stolen from years XXXX through XXXX. I have no knowledge of this company. I have not had any dealings or contracts with this company. I have never had any services with this company. I have not ever used any debit or credit card transactions with this company or their affiliates. I would like for Experian to remove this debt from my credit report."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Wells Fargo is inaccurately and unfairly reporting to credit bureaus and causing further debt entrapment to their customers. 

During the lockdown, I requested my loans be entered into a forbearance XXXX and I entered again from XXXX. XXXX did not communicate limits to this and subsequently removed them from this status resulting in 30-60-90 day late reporting. Again, no limits had been communicated to me or my co-signer, despite me making an additional request in XXXX to extend. 

When I inquired when/why these changes places to place, it took speaking to the XXXX to get an answer that wasn't "" you need to pay these to bring them current ... that's all we know '' and I waited an additional 15 days to be told they had no intention of acknowledging their lack of compassion, communication, or damage to my credit report. In addition to catching them rack fees in my account and being issued a refund for multiple instances of these fee assessments, I believe Wells Fargo is a predatory bank that should be investigated. 

They are resolving themselves of their place in the student debt crisis and selling their student loan accounts to a third party -- leaving thousands of us with loans nearly in default to instead deal with collection agencies where additional fees will be added. 

This is unfair, inaccurate, and it should be examined further to prevent Wells Fargo from further profiting from it's predation."
Debt collection,"ARS I would like to once again ask to have all the documents you claim you have obtained and sent to me to confirm that this is an accurate. I have NOT once received anything from you showing the information you claim you have sent. You sent me a bill and that is it. A bill that said emergency services balance owed XXXX. I have not received any else supporting what you keep saying. Why would I now after all this time do all of the steps your telling me to do for identity theft three years later.? Why don't you take the steps and submit the documents that you keep refusing to send verifying the debt is mine. It would be a lot easier for you to provide those documents than me going and claiming identity theft three years later. I have spent those three years trying to get you to provide me documents with my signature verifying the debt belongs to me and for three years you just continue to send me a bill that says emergency services balance due. That means nothing. Again, I have maintained medical insurance for over five years, maybe even longer than that. So again. Show me more than a bill, And when I say that it means show me the entire MEDICAL RECORD you have on file verifying this debt and we can move on. Otherwise, stop updating my credit reports every month with XXXX. You have my information so you can send me the medical records from the date of service you have on there. Because I have not been to any emergency room."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",My credit scores are way too low for my excellent credit history. It seems like the bureaus are getting kick backs from financial institutions to keep the consumer down to pay the very high interest rate loans.
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Credit card details from XXXX were sent to experian, the amount did not initially match the XXXX amount that was listed in my account. The impact of this was a warning that I had exceeded more than 50 % of my credit at XXXX, which is nowhere close to XXXX. 

This was rectified back to XXXX A month later, this change seems to have been reverted, and this has once again damaged my credit. 


Both of these mess ups are in my record, they both need correcting, in accordance with financial regulation and GDPR."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Background : My wife and I filed for chapter XXXX bankruptcy in XXXX. Meeting of creditors was XX/XX/XXXX. In XXXX of XXXX, we petitioned to convert to a XXXX due to income changes. We converted back to a XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX after my income went up due to a new job. It should also be noted that I have an auto loan through XXXX that is paid outside of the Plan and all payments have been on time ( as accurately reported on the credit report by XXXX ) Issue : I had an unsecured credit line with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( aka XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) included in the bankruptcy. Starting in XXXX of XXXX ( after the XXXX meeting concluded ) XXXX began reporting the account as late/delinquent, though they were receiving distributions from the trustee and my payments were all on time. Additionally, the account is reporting 'open ', instead of 'included in bankruptcy '. I filed disputes with all 3 credit bureaus, twice, disputing both the delinquent payments and account status. XXXX has refused to make any changes. None of the other creditors included in the bankruptcy are reporting the accounts as past due or open. 

The new job I started in XX/XX/XXXX requires that I relocate. I am applying for a mortgage loan ( provided I meet all the criteria and am approved by the bankruptcy judge ). The incorrect reporting filed by XXXX is harming me by lowering my credit score hindering my ability to obtain approval for an FHA mortgage I otherwise should qualify for."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","XXXX XXXX should not be reporting late to XXXX ; XXXX  and Transunion on the XXXX  XXXX  partial account number XXXX. ( Please see page attached from my credit report. ) I called XXXX to change the payment due date. The representative assured me that this was noted in my account. They continue to report this account late even though I make timely payments and have never missed a payment. This has been going on for years and I have called XXXX on numerous occasions and they have verified the new due date however, this account continues to report my payments as lates. This false reporting is seriously harming my credit score. It is a violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act not to report accurate information on a credit report. These lates need to be removed. I have contacted XXXX  as well as the bureaus to fix this, but I have not been successful."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I received a US Bank Relia Visa card that I never applied for in the mail. I called them and they said it appears a card was opened under my name through the Unemployment office int the state of Ohio. They also stated that the SS # they had on file did not match mine so I assume someone opened a card under may name and address with a made up SS #. 

I have spoken with XXXX XXXX and they have this noted and have called the credit bureau. I will also be calling the state of Ohio tomorrow to let them know about this situation. 

Thank you!

Checking or savings account,"I opened an account with Citi bank using links advertising a XXXX bonus. I met the requirements by depositing XXXX and keeping it in the account from XX/XX/2020 to XX/XX/2020. There was a waiting period of XXXX days after that, after the which Citi has still not deposited the bonus. They sent a letter stating they were unaware of any bonus associated with my account. I went through the steps of opening another account to check and aside from following the advertised link, there are no extra steps a customer needs to do in order to become eligible. Also, on XX/XX/2020, I contacted CitiBank through chat with XXXX and made sure everything was Ok with my bonus status. He stated that everything was fine. I have contacted the XXXX and the bank itself through phone calls and faxes to try and fix this situation and have the bonus I earned deposited into my account."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","XX/XX/XXXX I returned a XXXX XXXX XXXX as instructed by XXXX. XXXX had performed a preinspection and noted several minor repairs I should have completed before turn-in. I followed their direction and left all the documentation in the car front seat. XXXX still charged me for all the repairs. After several phone calls and multiple resubmissions of the documented receipts and pictures, XXXX finally removed most of the charges. I paid the lease termination fee of {$300.00} and a lost key for {$250.00} but XXXX continued to send me invoices each month. As you can see in the attached Experian report the balance changed almost monthly for no apparent reason or without any clear itemization. 

Finally, XXXX claimed that the roughly {$390.00} was for personal property tax. Since the State of VA prorates I ask XXXX to send me a statement of the tax record. They didn't send anything other than non-informational monthly statements. recently my credit score took a big hit 100+ points. After investigating I found that XXXX had charged off {$2800.00} dollars. 

I have escalated this to a supervisor who claims there is nothing they can do, I ask the supervisor who would not provide his name or case/claim number. I ask for the supervisor I was speaking with for the 3rd time and he said "" she '' would call me. I have received no call. 

I ask XXXX to update the credit bureaus with the status of the account has been paid in full. XXXX agrees it's been paid in full but refuses to report this to the bureaus or have the {$2800.00} charge off. 

This was a 3-year lease. Not a single payment was ever late. 

Hoping you can help me. I have Federal Government clearances and that charge off could prevent me from obtaining future clearances to provide assistance to our Federal clients. I explained the serious nature of this to XXXX they didn't seem to care. Thank you for any help you can provide."

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","XXXX has incorrectly reported three ( 3 ) 90-day late payments on my credit report during a federally mandated suspension of all student loan repayments. When I contacted them to correct this error in their reporting, they refused to correct it. 

According to Section 3513 ( d ) of the CARES Act ( Public Law 116-136 ), federal student loan repayment suspensions were supposed to be reported to consumer reporting agencies positively ( i.e., as if the borrower has been making regular payments. In relevant part subsection ( d ) reads : During the period in which the Secretary suspends payments on a loan under subsection ( a ), the Secretary shall ensure that, for the purpose of reporting information about the loan to a consumer reporting agency, any payment that has been suspended is treated as if it were a regularly scheduled payment made by a borrower. 

CARES Act suspension of federal student loan repayment was extended until XX/XX/2021.

I provided copies of my account information and payment history along with the letter from my lender which granted a 30 day extension. Experian refuses to update the account history properly.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I have become aware that that the credit reporting agencies may not be in compliance with certain provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and how it is reporting my credit information.

In accordance of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) : 605. Requirements relating to information contained in consumer reports [ 15 U.S.C. 1681c ] ( a ) Information exclu
ded from consumer reports. Except as authorized under subsection ( b ) of this section, no consumer reporting agency may make any consumer report containing any of the following items of information : ( 1 ) Cases under title 11 [ United States Code ] or under the Bankruptcy Act that, from the date of entry of the order for relief or the date of adjudication, as the case may be, antedate the report by more than 10 years.

604. Permissible purposes of consumer reports [ 15 U.S.C. 1681b ] ( a ) In general. Subject to subsection ( c ), any consumer reporting agency may furnish a consumer report under the following circumstances and no other : ( 1 ) In response to the order of a court having jurisdiction to issue such an order, or a subpoena issued in connection with proceedings before a Federal grand jury.

( 2 ) In accordance with the written instructions of the consumer to whom it relates.

With subsections 604 and 605, the credit reporting agencies did not get the information of my bankruptcy from the State of Tennessee nor did I express that information to be made public in any expressed written agreement or statement. The three credit reporting agencies received my personal credit information from public records which they are not in compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act.

Fair Credit Reporting Act states the regulation and laws that govern the three credit reporting agencies, however the misuse of personal information for financial gain harms consumers. I could not find a place to stay because that was on my credit report and reduce my score. I find it very difficult that I can not find a place to call home in a reasonable area do to the inconvenience of the misuse of my personal credit information."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Wells Fargo to request a downgrade of my wells Fargo propel card as I was no longer interested in paying the {$170.00} annual fee. I didn't think the fee justified the cards benefit. The representative presented various credit cards I could downgrade to that did not have an annual fee. After a 90-minute conversation, I decided to downgrade to the lower tier of the propel card that did not the annual key. I also allowed the representative to charge my checking account for the annual fee of {$170.00} in case the downgrade process takes long in order to avoid being charge a late fee since the annual fee was due. The representative ensured me everything be process and I will receive the new card in a few weeks. 

In the first half of XXXX, I spent a lot of times traveling which was extended due to the pandemic. I was in the west coast until XX/XX/XXXX. When I returned home in XXXX, I found several letters from wells Fargo stating that I owed them {$170.00} plus late fees/interest. Also, my credit report was flagged for missed payment. At first, I was confused and thought maybe someone stole the new card while I was away and used it. Because I know that I didn't owe wells Fargo anything especially since I paid them the {$170.00} annual fee back in XXXX to avoid any issues relating to downgrading my card. 

After having several conversations with wells Fargo bank tellers and two Case Specialist in the Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, they confirmed that the representative did not downgrade the card as he ensured me, he will do. Furthermore, they confirmed that they did receive my payment for the annual fee back in XXXX but failed to update my account with the new balance ( which was {$0.00} ) which resulted in them reporting me to the credit bureau. To explain, Wells Fargo continued to charge me for the annual fee even though I had already paid them the fee. Every month from XXXX to XXXX they reported a missed payment to all three credit bureaus. They apologized for their mistake and ensure me that they will contact the credit bureau to remove all the negative marks they put on my account as this was their negligence for not verifying their information about my account. It is now XX/XX/XXXX ( I spoke to them XXXX XXXX ) and the missed payment has not been removed. I also open a dispute with XXXX and XXXX said they refuse to remove it. It seems like the only thing left to do is to take them to court because they are violating the federal fair credit reporting act ( FCRA ) and has damaged my creditworthiness."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","XX/XX/XXXX RE : Request Investigation of Credit Inquiry on My Behalf Dear Sir or Ma'am, I recently conducted a review of my credit report, and I noticed that your agency showed one ( 1 ) credit inquiry that I find to be problematic. 
The first inquiry in question was apparently made by XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and I have no recollection of doing any business with XXXX. 
I contacted XXXX, and asked them to take action to get this inquiry removed from their records and to erase any record of the inquiry with all credit reporting agencies. They assured me they would comply with my request and take whatever steps necessary to resolve the issue, but I wanted to contact you as well, just to make sure this gets done. 

Please investigate this inquiry at your earliest possible convenience, as I am going to be applying for a home mortgage in the near future. I would very much like to ensure my credit score is showing an accurate depiction of my creditworthiness. 
Please update me with a full report on your findings within the next two weeks. I look forward to having this situation rectified as soon as possible. 
Thanks for your prompt attention to this matter,"
Debt collection,i have sent several letters and hired credit repair company they say i owe {$490.00} however this was a secured card and i gave them a security deposit of {$300.00} so the balance owed should only be {$490.00} they never applied the {$300.00} security deposit.
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I was shocked when I reviewed my credit report and found late payment on the dates below : 90 dates late as of XX/XX/2018 120 dates late as of XX/XX/2018 120 dates late as of XX/XX/2018 120 dates late as of XX/XX/2018 120 dates late as of XX/XX/2018 120 dates late as of XX/XX/2018 I am not sure how this happened, I believe that I had made my payments to you when I received my statements. My only thought is that my monthly statement did not get to me. I did not worry about making a payment when I was not receiving statements because I thought that loans were in deferment"
Debt collection,"I have attempted to contact this company multiple times regarding a debt that they are reporting to my credit. I have not even the slightest clue what the debt is and when I request validation, they just send me a print out of some bill that does not even describe the debt. Honestly, how many people can just say you owe something, don't provide proof, and expect you to pay. How are they doing this and to how many people thus far. The very last time, they sent me a letter in the mail attached stating that my claim was frivolous and they refuse to investigate any further. They did not provide me with anything I requested and simply stated that they sent verification and validation to the credit bureaus. If they refuse the investigate, they should not be allowed to continue reporting this harmful information to my credit reports. The received communication from them XX/XX/2021."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I have contacted Experian a total of three times to dispute inaccurate reporting on my credit report by my student loan servicer. 

The dates I have contacted Experian to file a dispute are : XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. 

The disputes in XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX were initiated by me through the Experian XXXX app. The XX/XX/XXXX dispute was taken over the phone by a dispute specialist. 

Each of the three disputes have consistently presented the same narrative : my account is being reported as 90 days late during a period of Income Based Repayment with a payment amount of {$0.00} due. 

I have submitted statements to Experian as part of the XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX disputes which reflect that no payment was due during the alleged 90-day delinquency in XX/XX/XXXX. 

I was unable to upload new evidence to the Experian consumer upload site because the files were too big on the first attempt. This caused the website to display an error message on further attempted uploads and also for any other sessions. 

The results from all of my disputes return with no change being made. The reason is because my student loan servicer has certified to Experian that the information is correct and as a result would remain. 

This is a boilerplate response and I do not feel that individual human attention has been given to my dispute. If that were the case, Experian could clearly see that it is not possible for my student loan account to be delinquent when no payment has been due multiple years prior to and after XX/XX/XXXX. 


I am aware of my rights if I disagree with the results. However, the remedies that are listed on my report are not available. I can not submit a statement of disagreement to be listed on my report nor have I been able to obtain the method and details of how the investigation was conducted. 

This is the ONLY delinquency on my report and as a result, my score and credit file are suffering. This impedes my ability to obtain credit which is causing me to suffer a loss. 

Experian should stop acting in favor of the student loan servicer and instead conduct investigation in a neutral format as they are legally obligated to do."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","The Experian will not freeze my credit report online despite entering all the required information asked by their website. 
I also tried their phone number to freeze my credit report without any success. 
They would like me to send the information by snail mail which is highly inconvenient. 

I did not have any problem freezing my info with XXXX and XXXX. 
I believe Experian has purposely made it hard so that consumers are forced to subscribe to their paid subscription to lock credit. I am sure they are violating some consent decree by making it impossible to freeze my credit report online.. 

It is extremely annoying that Experian makes money on my credit and makes it harder for me to control it."
Debt collection,"I recently found this account on my consumer reports on XX/XX/2021. I am not liable to this alleged debt with Credit Collection Services.

Credit Collection Services is also in violation of 15 USC 1692 d and 15 USC 1681, accuracy and fairness of credit reporting. This is an inaccurate collection that has been furnished to my consumer reports which has resulted in my credit worthiness and reputation being ruined. It seems as though this company is a collection agency, however I never received any correspondence from this company notifying me of who they are, what debt they are attempting to collect.

I sent a procedural letter to each, on XX/XX/2020 to ask of how they were acquiring the Bankruptcy information. According to law, all information obtained is to be reported directly to the Bureaus by direct lenders or parties involved, but the Courts do not. Neither could advise me of who or what source reported my Bankruptcy, XXXX XXXX to them directly. On my credit report, it states no known reporting agency and the Federal Courts do no report information directly to the Bureaus.

Checking or savings account,"A bonus not paid as promised by Citibank priority bonus savings and checking account signups offer : Under the promotion number Promo. XXXX I opened an account on XX/XX/XXXX, checking account ending XXXX/savings account ending XXXX. I have screenshots of the promotion at the time of the offer that promised a {$700.00} bonus after 60 days of fulfilling their deposit amounts, and for some unknown reason they add another 90 days to make sure those requirements were followed, I guess. But you don't get your bonus for at least five months. After the 5 months, the bonus still has not been paid. 

I opened the account on XX/XX/XXXX and didn't deposit anything at that time. On XX/XX/XXXX, I deposited {$500.00} to XXXX ( Citi waited a full 2 weeks before crediting it to my account. ) {$50000.00} was deposited into the savings account on XX/XX/XXXX.

I called on XXXX and inquired about the 90-day bonus payment and was informed I would have to wait until after XX/XX/XXXX, to see the promotion bonus deposited in my account. Customer service confirmed my promotion code at that time. 

Called again on XX/XX/XXXX and "" promo code not found. '' "" Customer service acknowledged that she saw the record from XX/XX/XXXX and sees the promotion code from that conversation, "" but it will not currently populate ''. This means that she can no longer verify that I am qualified to get the {$700.00} promotion bonus on the {$50000.00} deposit made in XXXX. She asked if I wanted to start a dispute. 

I opened a dispute. She gathered all my data and confirmed that I had screenshots of the terms of the bonus by requiring me to read every paragraph of every page. As I read, I confirmed that I conformed with every element of that offer.

When I call to dispute, they have my SS # flagged and I get locked into the automated system. In addition to them not removing or validating this account, they say I need to verify my info, however, they reach out to me using the very same address. This is all a tactic to keep reporting an inaccurate account on my credit report. Do they get paid to keep negative accounts listed? if so, that would explain their deceitful practices and blatant refusal to remove these accounts from my credit report. In addition, they recently added a new chargeoff on the account, leaving 2 chargeoffs back to back, when it was originally 1 chargeoff. Its now reported as 3 late payments, which gives any creditors the impression that I was late on 3 accounts. MY FICO score is XXXX, the lowest score of all three bureaus. in addition, they refuse to remove XXXX XXXX, who wrote asking EXPERIAN to remove this account as it was removed from the other 2 bureaus a 30 day late payment was added in error and XXXX XXXX  is now asking again for Experian to remove it.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I have been disputing with the bureaus since XX/XX/XXXX, some inquiries that I never approved of, and obviously did not obtain credit for. The bureaus did not delete the inquiries, nor did they respond within the 30-day timeframe that they are supposed to respond in. On XX/XX/XXXX I decided to give the bureaus another chance and sent another letter to each of them, demanding they delete the inquiries that I did not authorize. It is now XX/XX/XXXX and I still have absolutely nothing. No investigation was undertaken, no verification was made, and no response was sent. I have a legal right to all these things and the bureaus have a legal responsibility to respond to my disputes."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",I conacted XXXX in regards to this charge off on my credit thats been there for years and requested that they remove the incorrect information. AFter years of trying i started to see if there were any other ways to get this fixed I contacted XXXX and transunion along with XXXX with no success. Please help.
Debt collection,I cant remember a date but I went to flex shopper online to order a camera and make payments over time..I think it was weekly payments. I order the camera but never received the item. Ive tried many times to resolve this problem with the company speaking to many people. The account is now in collections which it should not be and everyday I receive calls and emails about a debt I do not owe because I never received the item.
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I have attempted to resolve these issue numerus time with the credit bureaus with no resolution. XXXX XXXX is reporting inaccurate and incorrectly. To start the account is still reporting as open and 120-149 days late, although the last payment is listed as XX/XX/2018. This would make the account way more than 149 days late forcing it into charge off status. Next the late day of payment is different on each credit bureau. If the information being reported is supposed to be "" verified '' how are the dates different. Finally there is a collection from XXXX XXXX XXXX and a Bankruptcy that need to be removed as well because the information does not match mine. This entire situation is completely disheartening. How can these companies just report stuff then make us American prove that what is being isn't true of correct. The entire credit reporting world needs to be revamped. Because right now it is completely unjust!"
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","All 3 Bureaus were notified of the Bankruptcy being reported on my credit report. I sent a procedural letter to each, on XX/XX/2020 to ask of how they were acquiring the Bankruptcy information. According to law, all information obtained is to be reported directly to the Bureaus by direct lenders or parties involved, but the Courts do not. Neither could advise me of who or what source reported my Bankruptcy, XXXX XXXX to them directly. On my credit report, it states no known reporting agency and the Federal Courts do no report information directly to the Bureaus. This direct intention to degrade my credit status has led me to inhabitable living arrangements, limited transportation and minimum income to live. The reporting was never verified and there was never a response from Experian, XXXX or XXXX."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",There is a company XXXXXXXX XXXX reporting a collection on my credit report and I have no idea who or what is. I have reached out to the credit bureaus and sent my identification ... .This XXXX company got bought out by XXXX and no one will respond to my letters .... I know the bureaus get paid by these companies and they took one look at my ID and figured ok .... black ... no response ... Sorry to rant I'm just so upset that the bureaus would allow this ... ...
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",As of XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX is continuing to report an expired charge off from XX/XX/XXXX all 3 crefit bureaus that is according to Texas Civil Practices and Remedies is expired. XXXX XXXX is now complicit and continues to further the fraud due to now having knowledge of the fraud and failing to immediately remove the injurious action. I contacted XXXX XXXX today and was unsuccessful in getting the fraud corrected. The representative suggested that I do whatever I have to do to resolve this issue. I'm about to suffer a denial of a Jumbo Mortgage Application due to this fraud and subsequent failure to immediately remove the derogatory entries from my all 3 credit bureaus. My complaint stands on : Texas Civil Practices and Remedies and Finance Code.
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","XXXX/XXXX flagged my Experian credit report as a serious delinquency as a Charge-off when I am current paid as agreed never late. I barely use this credit card and make all payments monthly as agreed. Why is this company reporting a serious charge-off over 120 days to my Experian report when I make all payments as agreed? This is an FCRA violation and needs to be investigated. More importantly, I am unable to dispute this status with Experian because I am not late and account is paid as agreed at the same time of serious delquency 120 day charge off flagging so dispute process will not allow it."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",I have an inquiry that I did not give permission for
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","My most recent contact with these companies was on XX/XX/XXXX when I sent in letters regarding inaccurate and unknown information on my credit reports. I began sending letters to them in XX/XX/XXXX and it's been 82 days to date with no resolution from either company. Again, I feel like my disputes are being ignored with them especially since XXXX was able to remove the exact same accounts from my consumer report. Based on FDCPA, 15 USC 1692e Section 807 ( 2 ) "" The false representation of ( A ) the character, amount, or legal status of any debt. '' I demand that these accounts be promptly deleted cause I am prepared to file for litigation due to the continuous stress you've caused me.

They are displaying inaccurate and misleading information about me!"
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",On XX/XX/2021 submitted a dispute to Transunion and XXXX  asking for validation of unauthorized and dated inquires that are being reported on my credit report. As of XX/XX/2021 I have not received validation or removal of inquires.
Credit card or prepaid card,I lost my us bank Relias card. I called and notified them. they told me to send in a copy of my id and which I did. and now they tell me that they cant issue me a new card. I have XXXX dollars on the card that had been canceled. I need my money asap I have bills to pay. altogether it has been four week since I contact them for the first time and still have not got response.
Debt collection,"I've sent multiple letters to this agency about this not being my account. After being advised by identitytheft.gov, I've completed and sent a fraud affidavit via certified mail. I can see they received it, but nothing has changed. See supporting documents. Even the USPS tracking.My official complaint is against MERCHANT AND PROF. My information was used to obtain an apartment, cell phone, and an auto loan with my ex-partner. I am a victim of identity theft and have put this off for too long. I've completed the proper steps, 1. notify creditors 2. police report 3. informed the state of Texas. The individual I've suspected for this theft is now deceased, and the police department said to contact the federal trade commission to seek relief. These companies disregard laws and dont care whos credit or lives they impact."
Debt collection,"IC systems responded to my complaint with a form that show they know my name and address. This is not a validation, it seems as if someone used my mane and address and obtained a phone and this company is requiring me to pay for it. I have not done any business with this company nor XXXX  and they should not be able to submit information thats false to the credit bureaus."
Debt collection,"XX/XX/22 @ XXXX called MRS associates to discuss collection notice on my account. I asked if payment were to be made if it would be removed from the credit report. I was told that they report to the credit bureaus every 30 days. I also advised I would need a letter stating that the debt had been cleared and that it would be removed from the credit report. I was told a "" release of debt letter '' would be sent. 

The XXXX agent omitted the fact that the letter would not include the language I had requested and did not indicate that, as I was told later on, no "" pay for delete '' would be possible. 

I believe that they were deceitful in their attempts to obtain payment and lied by omission. 

Further, XXXX confirmed this was sent to straight to collections. I was not given an opportunity to make good on my debt. I still have an account with XXXX for Internet services. No billing indicated I was delinquent and service was never cutoff. Further, they have record of our transfer service request with our new service address. 

In follow ups with XXXX XXXX, repeatedly told it would be removed from Credit and yet no follow ups."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",On XX/XX/2020. I requested Transunion and XXXX  to provide me with copies of the documents that they have in their files as of XX/XX/2020 that they used to verify the accuracy of the disputed account in the amount of {$8000.00}. The companies then sent me my credit report. However no evidence of the account being accurate was not recieved.This account does not show on my XXXX and is inaccurate.
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","XXXX XXXX XXXX  and Transunion should not be reporting each inquiry listed as a separate line item on my credit report for the 2020.

Checking or savings account,"I went to a branch to deposit my check on XX/XX/XXXX with a teller and have had delays with my check due to what I believe was discrimination and retaliation. On the date of XX/XX/XXXX, I had a bank teller problem where she had treated me unfairly and I think she retaliated against me by "" delaying '' my transaction and causing my funds to take longer than normal. It's been as of today ( XX/XX/XXXX ) that my check has still not cleared yet with the bank and I've called XXXX and XXXX to get a clear understanding of the hold time. The first customer service agent I've spoke to told me it was the branch that has the power to clear and hold a check longer than normal, then the second customer service ( on a different day ) told me it was their system that determines this which she said was too long because, and I agree with this being 11 days already. Now, before the institute responds with a rehears line, I've always deposit this financial institute check before for many years with US Bank and this check is a well established company ( XXXXXXXX XXXX ) that I have had for over 5 years as well, and this check was about the same amount as prior check amounts ( under {$1000.00} ) and I've never had a check bounce, decline or suspiciousness with a check nor my account. I've never had an overdraft or any fraud related suspicious activity with my 10 plus years with this bank. All of my accounts with US Bank is, and has been in excellent standings prior to this teller encounters which is why I believe was an act of retaliation and discrimination on that date and a person like her should not be in the banking profession mishandling Federal currencies any way she feels when she get upset with a customer. This 11 day hold is unreasonable and unprofessional when my checks always is 2-4 days ( at least from XXXXXXXX XXXX of a hold. And strangely this teller withheld my funds doing such a tragic event in world history that I guess she thought I would be like most and in dire need of money to survive during this pandemic."

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","This is my 3rd time submitting a complaint about having inaccurate information still reporting on my credit report. Experian is not cooperating with me on this matter and refuses to remove all fraudulent and inaccurate information from my credit profile. Experian keeps giving me the same auto-responses and they are avoiding me and refuse to look into this matter. 

It has been over 120 days & I feel like Im being taken advantage of and being ignored of my disputes. The law plainly states that failure to investigate these items within 30 days gives a reason to immediately remove those items from my credit report. It has been over 60 days so they should be deleted promptly. 

I demand these accounts be deleted immediately or I will file for litigation due to the stress you have caused me. My information was also impacted by the XXXX  data breach and may have gotten into the hands of the wrong person."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","After my personal information was exposed in the data breach of the Washington XXXX XXXX XXXX, I contacted each of the XXXX credit bureaus to place a freeze on my credit, as was recommended. However, Experian has refused to place a freeze on my credit, instead demanding that I send them a giant pile of documents and photocopies in first class mail to Texas, and then wait XXXX weeks to see if they felt like complying. 

I have the legal right to freeze my credit, and they do not have the right to refuse that request. They are obligated to place a freeze as requested in a timely manner, and I dont have weeks to wait, as the fraudsters who stolen my information are not going to sit around waiting a few weeks before trying to steal my identity. 

I have tried repeatedly to contact them, but there is no way to reach them. I can only access a recording recapping the instructions to gather, photocopy, and mail to them all of my personal information and identification, a piece of mail confirming my name and current address, etc., and to check back in XXXX days."

Mortgage,"XXXX sold my mortgage in early XX/XX/XXXX to US Bank. I was informed to follow up with US Bank regarding making sure my property taxes were paid. I spoke with one US Bank rep early in XXXX and they did pay the city tax. I was assured they would pay the XXXX  ( county ) tax by the end of the month when it was due. I called US Bank on XX/XX/XXXX and the rep said my taxes would be paid by the XXXX of XXXX. I called US Bank on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke to "" XXXX '' in the tax department who said they needed to get approval to pay the late fees. She said to call back in a couple days for more information. I called US Bank on XX/XX/XXXX. I spoke to "" XXXX '' in the tax department. He said the property tax in the amount of {$1400.00} which included late fees was paid the prior day. He said the transaction should show online with in 48 hours. I called US Bank on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke to the tax department supervisor "" XXXX '' who said the tax was not yet paid and she would have to find out why it was not paid. She assured me the tax should get paid by midnight on the XXXX. I called US bank on XX/XX/XXXX. I spoke to "" XXXX '' who said the tax was not paid. XXXX said they would have to get approval to pay any additional late fees and they would call back with an update."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","XX/XX/20 I wrote a letter to XXXX XXXX  for charge off account in the amount of XXXX. I requested under the FDCPA to the creditor to provide me with original signed documents that bares my signature or to remove the said account reporting on my credit that is not mine. They failed to do so and responded stating that it belongs to me with nothing to back it up. I sent a dispute exercising my right according to FCRA to XXXX and XXXX and both also refused to delete unverified accounts and ignored my request to reinvestigate that the accounts were being reported fraudulently since they failed to actually do a actual investigation. When I asked for documents used and the procedure that states that those said accounts were in fact accurate my request was denied, ignored and I was told that because a investigation was initially done they dont have to nor will they conduct another one. How is this even legal how can the credit bureaus get away with not following the law guide lines?"
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",I have called Experian and XXXX multiple times to correct the personal information they are reporting on me over 60 days ago. Both times I called and spoke with a representative. Both times the representatives stated they would delete the incorrect information. After reviewing my credit report I see the incorrect information is still reporting on my credit report.

I don't know what else I can do but I am not paying for things I did not buy. 

Thank you"
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Experian will not raise a credit score unless you sign up for Boost. The other 2 agencies give a score in the 700s.. Experian gives 612. That should be illegal. I paid off all collections and unless I pay for Boost, they are costing me higher interest rates and forced to pay a PMI when we get our mortgage."
Debt collection,"Per the CARES Act. The XXXX has announced that it will extend the moratorium until XX/XX/XXXX, XXXXCOVID-19 negatively affected me and could not pay rent. The company was informed."
Mortgage,"I was unaware of this regulation at the time, but then again I was trusting that my lender had our best interest at heart as well as knew the laws that govern them, but in reviewing XXXX  and the CFPB 's website it has come to my attention that when closing on a home the lender is required to provide you with a closing disclosure form issued at least 3 days before we sign the mortgage documents, at least 3 days before the borrower becomes contractually obligated to the lender so we may compare and ask questions before we go to the closing table. In our situation this was not the case but at the time I trusted my lender and mortgage loan officer, XXXX XXXX was doing right by me and was doing everything by law, I see now that is not the case. 

My husband and I did not receive our final closing disclosures until XX/XX/2020 at XXXX. We went to the closing table on XX/XX/2020 at XXXX. Based on our signed Note we became obligated to the lender on XX/XX/2020. We didn't even have a full 24 hours nor did we have a loan officer at our closing table to answer our questions. 

This is the second complaint I am writing to the CFPB regarding issues I have had with my mortgage originator and loan officer. This is another example of predatory lending as it is a blatant violation of the laws created to stop predatory lending and is the exact reason the CFPB had to be created."

Rep said "" We know the report is fake '' basically accusing me of faking an FTC report when it was literally filed and downloaded directly from the FTC 's website. I asked the rep to clarify why they think the report is fake if it was downloaded from the website ; I explained that the report has been updated by me every time new collections/information has come up and submitted. Rep refused to answer, stating again that they know that the report is fake, that she could not reveal details but that they are aware the report is not real. NO EXPLANATION. I asked if they could send me a letter instead to explain why if she could not do so over the phone and the rep stated she could only send me the same email they keep sending which is NO HELP.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","My Ally car loan is showing late payments. I have been attempting to have the late payments removed by disputing every month since XX/XX/XXXX. I've disputed between the months of XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX. Each time the dispute is initiated - Ally reports updated information to XXXX, XXXX  and XXXX  changing the level of delinquency and in which months the payments supposedly happened. The Fair Credit Report Act explains that since the information is inconsistent it must be removed and not updated. I attached the latest example of how Ally is reporting different late payments to XXXX  and XXXX. Please help me to have all late payments removed from my credit reports."

Wells Fargo is listing the forbearance amount as a unpaid second principal balance of {$4200.00} on my mortgage statement. 

I am unable to obtain a mortgage for another property based on the issue above. 

It was not disclosed to me that I would not have the opportunity to pay this balance off until the end of the loan term which is 30 years. I will be unable to secure any addition financing during my lifetime based on this unscrupulous tactic. 

I want to pay the {$4200.00} balance off. This amount is not an unpaid second principal balance which makes my financial situation look derogatory."

The XXXX payment was about {$45.00} more than the contract stated payment of {$380.00} per month. Then after I called them no one could tell me why on my first six conversations, so I informed my bank to not allow the payment be taken out of my checking account. Then I followed up even before the payment was due and spent another 3 hours on the phone trying to find out why the payment was higher and finally after six more conversations they told me that due the the change of state ( I bought the car in South Carolina and then had it retitled in Florida ) the sales tax amount changed and so does my payment. I said by over {$40.00}! So by now I just wanted to know what my payment would be and they could not give me a straight answer because they had put a {$15.00} NSF penalty due to my stop payment through my bank. Now they have given my a payment amount of {$400.00} but they want to charge me {$7.00} to take a payment over the phone and if I don't pay by XXXX XXXX, 2021 I will not only owe the NSF {$15.00} but also a {$15.00} late fee. This is driving me crazy. I am a XXXX year old senior living on a fixed income and just wanted to know what my payment was.

Mortgage,"I contacted CFPB in XX/XX/XXXX to report a problem with an escrow account that my mortgage lender created in error last year. The complaint number is # XXXX. 

That complaint was resolved by XX/XX/XXXX, when my mortgage lender closed the escrow account and reversed the payments that it had improperly debited from my mortgage payments to credit to the invalid escrow account. 

I recently received my form 1098 Mortgage Interest Statement for the XXXX tax year from my mortgage lender. On previous statements from previous tax years, Box 10 has been empty. On the statement for the XXXX tax year, Box 10 contains an amount -- {$810.00}. This amount is the same figure that factored into the escrow error that my lender made last year. 

I contacted my lender twice today ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and spoke to two separate customer service representatives to discuss the amount listed in Box 10 of the document, and to request a corrected XXXX Mortgage Interest Statement if the {$810.00} negatively impacts my tax filing. Neither representative seemed to fully understand the potential problems that this {$810.00} figure can cause and both stated that issuance of a corrected 1098 Mortgage Statements is not possible. Yet, the document itself clearly contains a box that the lender is required to check if a corrected document is issued and there is also verbiage on the back of the document informing the mortgagee how to proceed in the event that an error is identified. Neither representative knew how to assist me. 

My tax preparer stated that the {$810.00} figure that currently appears in Box 10 will reduce any tax refund that I may receive unless the XXXX statement is corrected. She also stated that this information on the form has been reported to IRS, so it must be corrected by the lender if it is incorrect. The escrow account was created by the lender in error, so the lender is obligated to correct its error, so that I am not further impacted or penalized by IRS."

Mortgage,"I have been paying my mortgage on time every month for over 20 years. On XX/XX/XXXX I mailed in enough money to apply to the principal balance and pay off the loan. I received the check back on XX/XX/2021 with a note saying the payoff amount had to be in certified funds. I called and they told me they would fax or mail a payoff statement to me but they would not give me the information over the phone or email. Then they explained they took several days to process payoffs so it would be best to add a week of interest to the payoff. My biggest issue is after reading the Payment coupon I receive every month there is absolutely nothing that says a final check that pays off a loan has to be in the form of certified funds. It took forever to get hold of someone at PHH Mortgage Services and they were not very helpful. I get it, they just want to hold off the receipt of funds as long as they can so they can make interest. I hope someone at the CFPB will look into this and get back to me."
Mortgage,"In XXXX of 2020 SLS Mortgage, charged off my second mortgage with no explanation. Resulting in me dropping 38 points on my credit score. Which also shows me now having a charge off in my report as well as my wife 's report.

Credit card or prepaid card,"I am using a Costco Visa card through Citibank to purchase online through Costco.com and avoid going into the stores. The purchases are being charged a PREMIUM price for home delivery. As a result, I am accumulating 2 % cash back by using the REQUIRED Costco Visa card. I received a {$120.00} Rewards Certificate in the Mail and called Citibank to apply this certificate to my credit card payment. They stated that though they allowed it this year, they are no allowing it in XXXX. 

They are requiring that the only way it can be used it to PHYSICALLY shop in Costco. COVID-19 is no better than it was in XXXX and is in fact much worse in South Florida with new Variants. I have an XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX and am too young to get the vaccine. I WILL NOT BE SHOPPING in any stores for the foreseeable future. Citibank is only too willing to have my charge to their card, but is unwilling to accept the reward certificate I receive from doing so. This is egregious and forcing people who want to spend their cash back into the stores and endangering their health and the health of others. 

I want Citibank to agree to take the certificate as an alternative form of payment against my credit card payment. It has a number that is unique to the certificate the correlates to the bar code. This should be a very easy thing to process and they DID accept this as a form of payment in XXXX, so their systems are already set up to handle this transaction."
Credit card or prepaid card,"My husband income was cut by 40 % last XXXX and returned to normal XX/XX/XXXX. He is salaried and worked long hard hours to help his company maintain as a good manager would. He did not qualify for government help as some other can. We quickly depleted our hard earned 3 months worth of savings and are now facing having to dip into our retirement savings. I wrote a letter to Department Store National Bank ( the bank behind Macy 's credit cards ) along with Citibank to ask them to please lower the outrageous interest rates ( 25-28 % ) to help be able to make the monthly payments. They refused. SECOND ISSUE. This last month I needed to pay the bill from two seperate accounts. After I paid half of the min due, I went to pay the rest out of another bank account of mine but it refused to take the payment saying that only one payment can be made per day resulting in a XXXX late fee. THIRD ISSUE. For XX/XX/XXXXpayment I tried to do a forbearance for the month. I had to send an email per Macy 's credit card 's webpage. I did and got turned down. I was charged late fee for paying 1 day late while waiting on their response. 

Seems to me that if Department Store National Bank ( DSNB ) or Citibank would, at the least, lower the outrageous interest rate, consumers like myself would be about pay our dues!"

We have no problem keeping the same monthly amount of {$580.00} & extending the term by 6 months or even 1 year like we did with our 1st mortgage with no problem. If they want to call it a Forbearance or a Modification it's ok. What's not ok, they tell us it is their investors choice.

I went to the websit to review the letter and while I'm appreciative of the {$400.00} credit. The issue is that i was charged {$2000.00} in interest and continue to get charged over $ 150 monthly for interest. This is an absorbent amount to sustain and I will never get out from under. I understand why this took place, however, I've had good standing credit, pay my bills timely and this bill was set up to pay in full over an 18 month period.

My ask is that the high % rate monthly is stopped immediacy as this isn't helping the situation and for a live phone call to take place with resolution.

Credit card or prepaid card,"I use autopay for most of my bills to ensure they are paid on time. However, I use the paper statements, sent in the mail, to validate purchases and reconcile my bank accounts. Furthermore, I check my email infrequently so I never enroll in paperless statements with billers. When checking my email, I noticed the attached "" Email 1 '' from Synchrony bank sent on XX/XX/XXXX informing me that my Amazon Store Card account will switch to paperless billing.

Again, I clicked the link to continue to receive paper statements. I should not have to respond to weekly emails to continue to get my credit card statements mailed to me. I wonder how many Synchrony credit card holders were impacted and how many did not see a notice of this change. I believe it is also very likely that some people could potentially miss a payment and be subject to late fees and interest charges as a result of not getting their statement in the mail as they have become accustomed. I always thought that consumers had to agree to receive paperless statements but apparently sending statements in the mail has become a cost burden for a company that charges almost 26 % interest.

After double-checking, they are, in fact, accessing a completely incorrect credit score. This is a problem because I would never have performed a hard pull unless I thought for sure I'd get approved. As previously stated, I'm rebuilding my credit and wouldn't want to lose even just a couple of points. 

I tried calling and got nothing but scratchy, pre-recorded prompts which ended because I wasn't approved and don't have an account number. There was an option to write them. But, realistically, is that really going to help me? There should be a way to get answers from a real person for something like this. 

I'm actually glad this happened because I would never trust this company to accurately report my payments if they can't even obtain an accurate report in the first place, but something needs to be done.

There are a multitude of accounts that are incorrect or may not even belong to me. It has been OVER 120 days and still no reply, My letters have been not only been faxed, but also uploaded and mail. Yet and still nothing. I am fully aware that we are in the middle of a global pandemic but this amount of time and no responses is unacceptable. At this point not only am I being ignored but the credit bureaus are taking advantage of an already difficult situation. If they do not have the manpower to process these requests they should not be reporting. It is quite unfair that as a consumer Im being dragged along."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Education loan shown on credit was fraud. The school was a fraud and education credentials were not honored. Numerous attempts to remove from credit report. Unfair XXXXXXXX XXXX reporting as well.
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",I made an online purchase at XXXX using my store card on XX/XX/2019 and subsequently returned some items from the order within the same month. The balance on my card was not updated correctly to reflect the return and interest was applied to the amount of the returned item. That amount was not paid because I contested it with the credit card company and later a penalty was applied for not paying the interest. They inevitably reversed the amounts when they looked into the charges meanwhile they reported my payment history as 60+ days late in XX/XX/2019 and reduced my credit line. First of all it is impossible to be 60+ days late when not even 60 days could transpire between the purchase date and the month of their reporting. Second of all I was never late as the amount was never owed. Several attempts to resolve with the company have yielded zero results.
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","This is my last option before I escalate this matter through the legal system. I have been attempting to remove fraudulent accounts from my credit report since XX/XX/2020 and for a process that should take no longer than 30 days, it has been over 240 days and I have neither received any investigation confirmation nor any result notices. The funny thing is, even the inaccurate personal information that was requested to be corrected, hasn't been done so. The fraud accounts are still showing on my report and it seems the bureaus are perfectly fine with violating my rights under the FCRA and the federal law. As stated, this is the last option before a lawsuit option is pursued."

Within a few hours they deleted the incorrect information but then lowered my credit score 18 points because of the investigation. Their reporting of the collection, even though incorrect and removed, thus affected my credit score adversely, jeopardizing my ability to secure a home loan. As a single mother, this affects not only myself, but my children. Nothing else changed on my credit report-no hard pulls on my credit, no cards opened, no delinquencies, and my score was not affected with the other two reporting agencies. This was solely an Experian response to a credit inquiry."
Credit card or prepaid card,"Synchrony Bank closed an account of mine without any prior notification, and have negatively affected my credit. 

I have several relationships with Synchrony Bank, and have been a customer for over 10 years. I got a notification this morning from XXXX XXXX that one of my account was closed. In checking, I noticed Synchrony had closed my XXXX XXXX line of credit because it's been 3 years since I used the account. Why I am filing a complaint is because they closed this account without any prior written or verbal communication to me in that regard. When I contacted them, they informed me they would not be able to open the account again, and if I wanted a new account I would have to apply. I've had this account open for 7 years, and have never missed a payment. They just recently even increased my limit. It isn't typical that car tires are replaced but every 4 years. By them closing the account it has affected my average age of credit and lowered my credit score. If I apply for a new account, it will only further lower my credit score, this was a horrible experience, and it's extremely unprofessional. If it was a matter of me using the card then you should have sent me a notice, and I would have happily used the card to keep the account active."

Debt collection,"I had a XXXX XXXX account for over 25 years and the final bill contained late fees that were charged erroneously. I received a collection notice which is attached to this complaint from Sequium Asset Solutions. The notice provided 30 days from receipt of the notice to dispute the item contained in the notice. 

I was not given the benefit of the full 30 days of the notice to dispute this debt, and Sequium reported the debt to XXXX  and likely other bureaus, on XX/XX/2021, just 20 days inside of the 30 allowed by law. This debt was already paid in full via electronic check and still remains on my credit file with XXXX. 

Due to the fact that I was not given the proper 30 days from receipt of the notice dated XX/XX/2021 to dispute the debt which was already paid, I was treated unfairly for not allowing me the proper time to dispute the debt, a full 30 days, which Sequium reported prematurely."
Debt collection,"On XX/XX/2016 IQ Data International added a derogatory mark on my credit report per XXXX. Upon further research, this account was transferred/sold and I am no longer responsible for the account. Debtor 's creditor did not verify this collection. Also, there was NO written form of communication, contract, or signature for this accused debt at all. A bill without a signature does not validate the debt and anybody can send a bill and say its mine. According to the FCRA, IQ Data International has violated my rights as a consumer and I'm requesting legal action to remove this account immediately."

You are required under the FCRA to have a copy of the original creditors documentation on file to verify that this information is mine and is correct. In the results of your first investigation and subsequent reinvestigation, you stated in writing that you verified that these items are being reported correctly? Who verified these accounts? You have NOT provided me a copy of ANY original documentation ( a consumer contract with my signature on it ) as required under Section 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) & Section 611 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ). Furthermore you have failed to provide the method of verification as required under Section 611 ( a ) ( 7 ). Please be advised that under Section 611 ( 5 ) ( A ) of the FCRA you are required to promptly DELETE all information which can not be verified.

The law is very clear as to the Civil liability and the remedy available to me ( Section 616 & 617 ) if you fail to comply with Federal Law. I am a litigious consumer and fully intend on pursuing litigation in this matter to enforce my rights under the FCRA.

I demand the following accounts be verified or deleted immediately."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX On each one of these times, I have reached out to WFDS letting them know that there is an authorized late payment on my closed account. I do not approve of this late payment and I had a really good payment history on this closed account. 

I have not supplied proof under the doctrine of estoppel by silence, Engelhardt v. Gravens ( mo ) 281 SW 715,719, I presume no proof of the alleged debt, therefore any such debt, in fact, exist."
Checking or savings account,"I was in XXXX XXXX with friends on a trip in XXXX when my wallet and phone were stolen at a restaurant. After failing to find the stolen phone and wallet, I contacted SUNTRUST and reported my card stolen. At that time they went over several transactions that included ATM withdrawals. During this recorded line, I let them know what was my last transaction and all the fraud one. They made two cases - one for the ATM charges and the other for actual credit charges. At the same time I had to contact XXXX and try to get a new phone. I received a letter stating that both fraud charges were denied and contacted SUNTRUST to find out why. They refused to give us information and stated that we could only do an appeal. They sent us the form needed and I filled it out. In the appeal, I showed proof of requesting new phones, money transfers that my wife sent to my friends since I had no way of getting cash since my bank account was emptied. After 45 days - where we called several times and were told that no information could be given - we received a second denial. There was no explanation, no documentation of the investigation to back up the decision. We recorded this phone call because of all the false information the bank kept giving us. We were finally sent to a supervisor who stated that there was nothing else we can do. After an appeal is denied there is no futher procedure to fight for injustice. There is no proof of the investigation and the supervisor could not give us a reason for the denial. We recorded the supervisor informing us the the decision is given to a specialist and once they decide SUNTRUST will not do anything else. My identity was stolen, my bank account was emptied ( over {$1000.00} ) - my bank history shows I have never taken out more than XXXX cash ever at one time - EVER since I opened the account but they refused to find 5 transactions of XXXX at an atm unsuspicious! At a time where we need funds and shouldn't be playing around with a family 's finances, SUNTRUST literally told me they would do nothing. I'm considering getting an attorney because this is UNFAIR and ILLEGAL!"

Debt collection,"Dear Sir/maam Subject : complaint about unlawful collection activity of a credit card, & collection agency. 
Being a dentist, I had no source of income for months ( 6 ) last yr, due to covid mandatory shutdown. 
but XXXX XXXX kept calling, emailing me for monthly dues.all credit card cos were required to offer a deferral programme.but this is the only credit card, that did not even have a deferral programme. they only waived late fees for 2 months, and kept charging me even late fees?? 
I talked to them couple of times, once the agent said, its ok if I cant pay, they will stop the collection for a period of time. But they never did that, only kept adding late fees, and sending me monthly bills, month after month.shockingly, they were mean enough to call me all the time, even on my home phone, and disturb sleep of seniors at home! 
Due to their lack of total sensitivity, I stopped even trying to talk to them.whereas, all other credit cards cos, have been humane, and offered my deferment plans.and I am paying them all on time now. 
I do know, that all credit cards cos were supposed to offer deferment plans, to those effected by lockdown, and total loss of income.but, XXXX XXXX had no such plan?? 
I am also head of household, so any effect on my credit score adversely effects the whole family.its not even my fault. 
my office was closed again since XXXX XXXX, due to very high covid cases in this county. 
i am trying to take baby steps to re-open, but not much business.it will take few months to even get business back to where i can afford to pay essential bills. 
dont forget, i have to file taxes too. 
all the late fees added so many times ( aleast 6 times ) need to be removed. 
i can only think of paying sometime next yr, in 2022, not this yr. 
Finally, XXXX XXXX was quick to transfer my acc to a collection agency.i just can not can not afford to pay this years sir. Have soo many urgent bills like electricity, food, gas, rent,,, to pay first. 
I have seniors at home too. 
I have no choice to file a complaint about this ongoing harassment.

Credit card or prepaid card,XX/XX/2019 i received my statement with fraudulent charges. i called to resolve the issue. At which time I was told they would handle the fraudulent charges and close my card and send me a new card. I received my new card in XXXX. I then received another statement with fraudulent charges that were transferred over from the previous account. i called multiple times between XXXX and XXXX. I kept getting transferred to the fraud department back to the costumer service department to the investigation department. At one point in XXXX the investigative department said they would look into it but was never assigned to anyone. This entire time I kept making the statement that i did not want this to affect my credit score. They said they were making corrections. My credit score was negatively impacted and my credit limit was dropped from XXXX to XXXX. I called last week and the week before each time with the person on the only line stating to give it 7 -10 business days to get resolved. At this point I feel like I am being harassed and taken advantage of. At one point i was getting daily calls from a Robo call to pay the bill. I hope that all my calls have been recorded as proof of what I am being put through. My credit score has been negatively affected and I am now having to wait to start my refinance due to the hit on my credit score. I have been treated poorly as I would have expected that by this point I would have been assigned 1 agent to take care of these issues for me.

Credit card or prepaid card,"I have described the problem prior, and have a file at Citibank regarding this complaint. 

I raised several points with Citibank, NA., but in their reply my specific disagreements with Citibank 's handling of my account were not addressed. I cited at least three unanswered letters/correspondence to the company many months ago, and I also documents an inability to reach Citibank 's customer service department via telephone, during the early months of the Covid pandemic. Citibank, specifically, directed people to its website in order to resolve account problems. I advised in my recent CFPB complaint and my prior correspondence, that my password was not operational, and I was unable to proceed in this manner ( contacting via the phone loan ).

In my complaint to Citibank, they did not address any of their failings to deliver adequate customer service, via a reasonable wait time, and by answering my ( documented ) mailings to their offices. Instead, when reached at their corporate office I was advised by XXXX XXXX that I "" should have called everyday, '' despite my advising her wait times were excessive, and I had limited time due to being on my work break, etc.

I would request a full review be done of all the circumstances of me losing my points. I have taken many hours to review and catalog phone records, mailings, etc., whereas Citibank has given this no true, in depth review.

Debt collection,"There is an attempt to collect a debt that does not belong to me from Professional Debt Mediation Inc I have been sending multiple disputes about this debt being on my reports to XXXX and XXXX since XX/XX/XXXX. Constantly sending letters and no response from anyone. 

Today I got a notice dated XX/XX/XXXX from Professional Debt Mediation with a copy of a Move out settlement report with an address in XXXX XXXX, FL in which I have never resided and have been living in XXXX, ID since Mid XXXX so I don't see how I can have a lease agreement in Florida. 

The information that was sent does not even have a my signature or signed of my name. 

Would like to know how this debt was verified and if my full social and date of birth was given or any copies of my identification was provided. 

This is a completely false debt. Addressed it many times and not after 5 months and putting in a complaint is when they actually start the investigation. 

Also I do not even see XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in the state of Idaho."
Student loan,My account was transferred to this new agency and at the time I received my new balance the balance was thousands of dollars more than what it c was worth the previous agency.

Despite the implementation of the CAREs act and a freeze on student loans per the Dept of Education. XXXX claims that they are exempt from the CARES Act passed XX/XX/2020 And with Bidens EO. They have refused to remove the garnishment, and they claim they are exempt from Federal Law and New York State Law and will not remove the garnishment or reimburse me funds that they are attempting to collect. I spoke with multiple managers, and there was no equitable outcome. I have paid off nearly 90 % of the value of the loan and the loan was suspended per Federal Law in XXXX 2020 during the Covid Crisis. The company claims they are only servicing the loan and will not work out a solution nor pull back the Garnishment to comply with Federal law.

I am attempting to refinance and the new lender informed me that the mortgage was not reported on my credit report. I contacted ShellPoint numerous times for resolution. They sent me a notice on XX/XX/XXXX that the error had been corrected. 

I verified with 2 of the CCB 's that the loan was now reflected on my credit report. 

In continuing with the Re-Fi I am now told that ShellPoint will NOT release the payoff information because I am not on the loan - yet they are reporting the loan on my credit report.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",On XX/XX/2020 I sent a letter re : inaccurate and unknown things on my credit report. It has been over 60 days and I have not received a response yet. I feel like I am being ignored and taken advantage of regarding my disputes.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I requested Mortgage Forbearance XXXX XXXX to provide time to adjust to changes with income. On XX/XX/XXXX, I requested the forbearance be removed. Somehow Wells is stating I re-requested an active forbearance. This is inaccurate, Wells Fargo advised I would need to make three payments to reinstate my loan prior to any modification. I began making payments in XX/XX/XXXX and through XX/XX/XXXX. In XXXX, I met the requirements for modification. Wells dispatched a title company 30 days later on XXXX to sign paperwork. In XX/XX/XXXX I began calling Wells Fargo, requesting an update after I noticed my XXXX payment was not applied to my mortgage and placed in a suspension account. I requested my credit report be updated. Wells is reporting NR XX/XX/XXXX. I made payments in XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX. The reporting is making it appear I have not made any payments for 9 months ; furthermore l, have a hardship. My report also has a notation that I am making a partial payment agreement. I escalated to the Wells Fargo Executive Team and have provided them 14 business days to correct the information. I would like the comments on my report updated to paying as agreed. I never paid partial payments. I deferred three payments to the end of my loan. In addition paid 8 additional payments since loan origination. Because I set up bi-weekly payments. I would also like the months I made payments to reflect those. 
It was my understanding the forbearance would not reflect poorly. If I new it would take 6 months to reinstate / modify my loan I would have repaid the suspended payments. This information was not discussed as we are all in uncharted times. I was working with my financial institution on a new loan and their underwriting flagged the non reporting mortgage payments."

Debt collection,"I received my first contact by mail from Account Resolution Services ( ARS ) on XX/XX/XXXX alleging that I owed a debt and that it would be reported to my credit within 15 days of the letter which was dated for XX/XX/XXXX XXXXI immediately responded to this letter by sending a Validation letter by certified mail on the same date I received it XX/XX/XXXX. I asked for original copies, signed documents with my name admitting that I owe this alleged debt, among other documents. 
However, I did not receive any type of documents providing me with validation of the alleged debt. I then on XX/XX/XXXX sent a dispute letter by certified mail disputing the alleged debt and asking that all negative remarks be removed from my credit file that was reported to the three major bureaus ( XXXX XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX ) on XX/XX/XXXX affecting my credit negatively in a significant way. Not only did I not have the opportunity to respond or dispute this debt in a timely manner before it went on my credit file, my first contact by mail was to tell me it was being reported to my credit by the named company. To add to that I received no documents to validate that I owe ARS or any other company. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter in response to my validation request from ARS ( Account resolution services ) stating that the debt was verified by them, again this was just a letter from ARS stating this, which is not what I asked for. I asked for validation with proof in the form of documents with the name and address of the alleged creditor among other things that I have not received as of yet. I responded again to tis letter by certified mail stating that I did not ask for a statement of verification from ARS and that they failed to validate the debt and provide me with proof. I asked that because of their failure to do so that the debt be removed from my credit file and closed from their records for good. I also sent a copy of that validation request to the three major bureaus on XX/XX/XXXX and asked that they remove the negative remars from this company as well."

Debt collection,"When I moved out from this apartment that we were renting, we deliver the keys to the staff in the front desk resident services, they checked the apartment and once that happened they did not lock the door, We took pictures of everything ( including the kitchen countertop ) and weeks later they sent an envelope in the mail saying they will give us back money from the deposit, after that the company that rents these apartments sent us another envelope by mail ( week way after the first one ), stating that there was damage in the kitchen ( we did not do this damage ) since we delivered keys weeks before of this event and took photographic evidence since we refused to pay this debt they passed this to a debt collector ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ). I explained to them that I disputed with the apartment company this debt and had evidence that we did not owe anything, they said to me is just {$300.00} and tried to harras me about impacting my credit score for years if I did not pay them. 

I still have the photos and the evidence of the email communications with the apartment complex company when I disputed this fake debt."
Credit card or prepaid card,I have never been late on my XXXX XXXX account ending in XXXX and always kept the balance low. This is insane because I worked hard to keep my account open. My social security number is XXXX and my SSN is XXXX.
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",I contacted this creditor ( Convergent Outsourcing ) on XX/XX/XXXX via certified mail ( tracking info XXXX ) Explaining that they need to verify that this debt belongs to me and the only thing they sent me was a old bill which doesn't meet the standards of verifying the debit. I never had an account with XXXX and also didn't recognize the phone number on the account. They failed to show proper evidence bearing my signature and they are reporting negative late payments on my credit report which is not allowing me to get approved with lenders. I sent another certified letter stating that a bill does not prove this account is mine and now they haven't responded and its been over 30 days. Letter sent certified and delivered on XX/XX/XXXX. ( Tracking info ( trackingID XXXX ) I sent another Certified letter on XX/XX/XXXX but I feel they will not respond due to their prior actions so I decided to go ahead and file a complaint. This is the only negative item that is on my XXXX and XXXX that is holding myself and my family back and I really don't appreciate them violating the law and continue to ignore my request. This is inaccurate information being reported and needs to stop immediately.
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Within my credit report under the Landlord-Tenant History there is a judgement. The disposition of the judgement reads : JUDGEMENT WITH RESTITUTION OF PREMISES. The filing date is showing XX/XX/XXXX and the judgement date shows XX/XX/XXXX. This information is inaccurate. There was a satisfaction of judgment filed on XX/XX/XXXX. This information should have never showed up on any of my credit reports. I lived in the said address for 6 months after the original judgement was filed. There was never an eviction yet it appears to look that way when my credit is pulled.

Mortgage,"My mortgage with Freedom Mortgage was refinanced through XXXX XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. Freedom Mortgage received their payment on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. At that time I had a balance of {$3.00}, XXXX in my escrow account that was due me. Freedom Mortgage claims that the payment was sent on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Freedom Mortgage to inquire about the status of the payment. I was told that they would take no action to track the payment until it was 30 days past due. When I asked for a tracking number so I could track the payment I was told that Freedom Mortgage does not provide that information and would take no further action until 30 days after the date they claim they sent the payment. I also asked about my year end statement fot tax purposes and was told that the "" only obligation they had was to provide that statement by XXXX. I did not receive that statement until XX/XX/XXXX. Freedom Mortgage has been a horrible company to deal with and should never be allowed to handle VA mortgages. If I were 1 day late in sending a payment they would change me hundreds of dollars in late fees. In fact, I was on an auto pay system and my escrow charges changed by XXXX cents. Instead of notifying me that the amount changed they charges me {$350.00} in late fees three days after the payment was due. A very disreputable company."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I ask that a statement be put in the XXXX account 1 ) Not my account and Fraud of Ownership. I asked for proof of Ownership never given. I disputed the account and asked for a statement be put in all my accounts that I invoke all rights, none waived ever. All three refused to do this and you can not dispute on line unless you agree to their terms. I refused to agree to them. Phone dispute is almost impossible to get done."
Vehicle loan or lease,"I purchased a used car XX/XX/XXXX with the first payment due XX/XX/XXXX in the amount {$470.00}. The finance agreement was for 72 months which ended XX/XX/XXXX. I paid an additional 4 months with the last payment send in XX/XX/XXXX which covered deferred installments during the life of the loan. I completed the 72 months and the contract amount of {$34000.00}. 

When I called to get information on my account, the automatic system stated that I had a payment of {$3100.00} due XX/XX/XXXX. When I called to get access to my online account information, it was described to me as an "" end of contract '' payment. I requested an explanation of the additional charge with their online customer service with no response ; I sent XXXX Priority Mail letters to their XXXX, NC headquarters for the President, XXXX XXXX XXXX and their COO - no response to date. I submitted a review with Consumer Affairs which was forwarded to the company for a response - no response to date. I reported this as a fraud claim with FTC today. That's when I found this website for finance problems."
Mortgage,"I am writing to you concerning an {$3600.00} escrow overage in my Wells Fargo mortgage account that they are refusing to disperse to me. I had applied for a Senior Homeowner exemption in 2020 for my local county ( XXXX, XXXX XXXX and was granted the exemption, thus resulting in the escrow overage. 
Additionally, I applied for and was granted a mortgage covid relief suspension, offered by Wells due to the ongoing pandemic. My income has suffered in 2020, by almost 45 %, and my Social Security isn't helping me cover my expenses. I've had this mortgage with them for over 10 years and have always been on time with my payments. 
So, I don't understand they will not disburse me the ooverage escrow funds. The funds were in escrow, but they are acting like my account is delinquent, which it is not. 
This is not right to treat a senior citizen this way. Please review my account and disburse me my money. 
First, I contacted Wells Fargo directly and was refused. Then I wrote to my congresswoman who received an refusal from a case specialist XXXX XXXX. Thank you for any assistance you can provide."
Debt collection,I made several attempts to remove SCA collections off my XXXX  credit report and was unsuccessful. There are 2 of the same reportings with the same amount and one different amount but all three accts are from the same company. They failed to verify validity of the account and XXXX failed to respond and remove said reports
Credit card or prepaid card,"1. I am not receiving interest charged by XXXX XXXX  master card from merchant-initiated refunds in the amounts of {$100.00} and {$490.00}. ( explanations for refunds explained in complaint ) 2. My second concern is that my interest remains the same albeit that I am paying double the monthly payment! 
Both above listed refunds were refunded due to charge errors to my credit card from merchants. I reached out to XXXX XXXX  XX/XX/XXXX and was informed that I was not entitled to an "" interest refund '' whether the refund was from a charge or return error. I made a complaint against this company XX/XX/XXXX due to its failure to recover funds from an illegal and unauthorized transaction. For this reason, I decided to work with XXXX and XXXX to recover funds that were posted to my account in error. XXXX account has two cards on file and the debit card that I used did not go through because the system used my delivery addresss zip code. I caught it immediately and corrected the error with the agent but not until the system charged the XXXX  XXXX  credit card thus, I had to wait for a refund. XXXX  XXXX  did not have authorization to charge my card and it took me to make a complaint with XXXX XXXX to get my funds back! 

My second concern is that my interest charges do not seem to change. I inquired about my interests amount and was given a rate 3.35 % ; Variable 21.99 % and XXXX I guess it means APR. I asked the agent several times to slow down and explain what was going on, uncertain if she knew. I inquired again if I could have my interest rate lowered and was told there were no promotions at this time. I went on to question How can the company feign to provide COVID-19 relief payment assistance and not offer the means to lower interest rates for the customer to continue to make payments? It appears to be ALL A RUSE! 

Attached you will see that the interest rates charged monthly do not change. On my XX/XX/XXXX statement the available credit was listed as {$570.00} and the payment due was {$170.00}. XX/XX/XXXX reflects a credit in the amount of {$490.00}, INCREASING THE AVAILABLE CREDIT TO {$1000.00} and yet the payment amount does not change! You can also see this in the increased payment amounts ( agent will excuse the cut and paste attachment for this card company has not provided online earlier statements for several years ) for example a payment of {$450.00} posted on XX/XX/XXXX reflected an interest difference from a {$200.00} made the prior month of {$0.00}! 
I have been with this company since the early XXXX and the number amount of monies applied have always affected the payment amount due to change from either higher to lower! It is as if no one is monitoring the system!"
Checking or savings account,"On XX/XX/2020 I received a letter dated XXXX XXXX 2020, stating that my account would be closed. After careful review from the Fraud Department it has been determined that nothing ill was found and any remaining balance would be refunded in the form of a check mailed to current billing address. 

Account summary shows that a closing debit of {$3900.00} on XX/XX/ 2020. And account has been fully closed. But I have yet to recieve my balance check. And after many calls to the company I've been meet with nothing but resistance."
Mortgage,"On XX/XX/2021, the mortgage company that holds my mortgage Select Portfolio Servicing withdrew via checking account XXXX without my verbal consent. I immediately contacted the company to ask them to expedite the claim to return the funds back into my checking account. As a result of their error, my account was overdrawn more than {$500.00} dollars. This occurred during a snowstorm and I have two children. I had other bills scheduled to be paid that could not be processed. This caused so much stress, irritation, and frustration. I called the company several times on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. To no avail did they give me an exact date as to when my funds would be available refunded. Every time I spoke to a representative from Select Portfolio Servicing they provided conflicting information about the process for refunding the funds and could not provide a definitive timeline."
Debt collection,"The original debt amount was incorrect. I settled on a 3 payment payoff after agreeing to the final amount of {$230.00} which was more than the original final payment. The collection 's representative NEVER informed me of an ADDITIONAL charge for each payment. The first payment as stated by the representative XXXX on XX/XX/2021, at approximately XXXX XXXX, was in the amount of XXXX with two additional payments of {$66.00} to be automatically deducted on XX/XX/2021, and XX/XX/2021. Today, I looked at my bank account, and the company withdrew an extra XXXX without my permission or knowledge. When I contacted Receivables Performance Management to inquire, they said it was an additional fee for service. This information was never presented to me or I would never have agreed to the settlement as the original amount was incorrect as I had told them. This is a practice of deception to the consumer and particularly in a time of pandemic and financial devastation for many, including myself."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",I have been looking at my credit report and it was brought to my attention that there are several errors and fraudulent accounts that I have no contracts with these companies. I do not recall doing business or applying for accounts with the following : -XXXX XXXX # XXXX -XXXX  # XXXX -XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX -XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX -XXXX XXXX XXXX  # XXXX -XXXX XXXX XXXX # XXXX

The fraud protection system that the card uses flagged these as potential fraud and emailed me to confirm or deny the charges.

When I received my statement I noticed that we were still charged for the fraudulent charges despite reporting that they were not authorized. I called the credit card provider earlier in XX/XX/XXXX and was told that even though we already reported the charges as fraudulent that we still had to submit a transaction dispute after the fact. I submitted disputes for 4 charges on XX/XX/XXXX and 2 more on XX/XX/XXXX. For each of those disputes I received notices back a week later stating that we will not be credited back for those charges because we have more than 10 cards.

Checking or savings account,"Citibank reduces next day Institutional Transfers to ones External Accounts from XXXX to XXXX XXXX XXXX REDUCTION!! 


Dear Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, I just found out that Citibank has reduced their next day Inter Institutional Transfers to ones External Accounts have been lowered from XXXX  to XXXX} until further notice. That is a XXXX XXXX REDUCTION! This just happened recently and I believe it is due to the whole XXXX shorting saga. What this policy can do is put the individual investor behind the 8-ball because they may need to move their money into their brokerage accounts to cover their trades. Citibanks standard service takes 3-5 days that is longer than the 2-day settlement date one is given to settle their stock trades. I also ask you, What good is being able to transfer only XXXX  a day? 

These are the messages that is posted once you sign into your Citibank account : - Effective immediately, as a security measure to protect Citibank accounts, the limits for next day Inter Institutional Transfers to your External Accounts have been lowered to XXXX until further notice. You can continue using the standard service to transfer to your External Accounts for amounts greater than XXXX 


When taking to a Citibank representative, these were their responses : - We never intent to upset our customers however it is applied to secure the fraud transactions.. 

- It is to protect Citibank accounts from a heightened risk of fraud, I am sorry for any inconvenience this has caused to you - It was initially XXXX using next day service now it was lowered to XXXX whereas standard transfer is still same with limit of XXXX - As an enhanced security measure and to protect Citibank accounts from a heightened risk of fraud, the limits for next day Inter Institution Transfers were lowered. You are still able to send IIT 's with a higher amount using the standard service. 

- However this change was made to all our customers however you can still transfer through standard transfer type for XXXX per day and monthly limit is XXXX I think that this seems like something to look into."

I called New American and asked the Loan Officer why they paid it off-with NO SIGNED AGREEMENT-they did not have the best rates. They avoided my calls- and two days later said they were working to return the ACH payment. They did get it reversed, and now my payment/and auto pay were not on anymore with XXXX XXXX. I have always maintained a credit score of over 820. I later received check # XXXX dated XX/XX/20 amount of {$160.00} from New American. I repeatedly called to ask what this check was for- and if I should cash it. I deposited the check and it bounced. Yesterday, I received notice that my XXXX SCORE plummeted 166 points because of a letter my mortgage company sent stating my mortgage was paid in full/then they removed the letter and if adversely affected my score. I do need a mortgage within one year and my score is now much LOWER which will inadvertently my ability to receive a competitive mortgage rate. I am contacting them now-as they would NOT return my calls-nor answer my emails."
Debt collection,Debt was paid in full on XX/XX/2020. We were told XXXX would update our credit report within 30 days. They are still reporting a balance to this day on all 3 credit burueas for {$54.00}. They recently mailed me a letter requesting me to settle the debt of {$54.00} and pay {$27.00}. This account was paid in full!!!!
Mortgage,"I received an escrow check in my deceased husband and my name. Check dated XX/XX/XXXX. I contacted NewRez LLC and requested the check be re issued in my name. I did not hear anything so I contacted them on XX/XX/XXXX to inquire. On tis date I gave my routing info for my bank and was told it would be in my account within 2 days. It was not. I called on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and to this date XX/XX/XXXX it is still not in my account."
Credit card or prepaid card,"To Whom It May Concern : This letter is after exhausting all avenues on a current/past situation with Barclay card Frontier credit card. XXXX of XXXX I traveled to Florida for vacation. In order check in my return flight I had to pay with a credit card. I used my XXXX card and paid {$120.00} dollars. When I received my Frontier Barclay Card statement in XX/XX/XXXX, that is when I saw that they auto charged my account for the same amount of {$120.00}. I called Barclay to dispute the charges, sent the statement for my credit card that I used to pay for check in. Called to follow up with Barclay and they said they never received the fax. So I sent it again, this continued for months- with sending the fax statements and being told that they never received the proof. Barclay also advised me to go dispute charges with the other credit card company and I refused that, because I personally paid with that card ( I was not going to dispute something that I paid for ). This continued, within that time I also paid off the balance with Barclay of over {$2000.00} minus the {$120.00} just to close the account and continue to dispute the charges. In XX/XX/XXXX, while this was still going on, I faxed again the statements and Barclay sent a letter to tell me that they received the statements but unfortunately it was past the dispute range and expired. As you can see that I was beyond frustrated- why would I pay a huge lump sum and leave {$120.00} on the account if I owed that. I still call about every 6 months, because now, they put me in collections for {$400.00} and yet I can't even settle that because it has been charged off and they have no way to apply a payment. This has gone way too far on the credit cards part and I feel that proof and faxes were intentionally disappearing or they were giving me the wrong fax number- to where the statements and proof just got dismissed, until they saw that the faxes and the dates of my dispute went out of the range. I would like for this case to be settled and off of my credit report, as it has not only been an emotional mess - when you would be able to see that I have an excellent history of paying bills and not debt with credit cards whatsoever. This whole situation has sabotaged me with lenders and prevented me being able to buy a house with the best credit score I can have if this was not on the report. Please consider reviewing and settling this account in any way to release what is not even my liability."

When I discovered this I immediately called my bank to see if they could halt or suspend the payment. They attemped to do so and were unable to. 

Both payments cleared by bank on XX/XX/2020 and were "" GOOD FUNDS ''.

XXXX XXXX suggested I call Loan Care and ask them to refund the 2nd over payment. I did so, and they told me to email a request to "" XXXX ''. I did that, and they replied stating that they needed a bank statement. At that time, I had not received the bank statement yet but sent them a 'screen shot '' of my bank portal showing the transaction clearing the bank. That apparently wasn't good enough. They replied with a closed "" ticket XXXX ''. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted XXXX XXXX and an agent and I together called Loan Care in an attempt to solve the issue. We were unable to get the issue resolved with the agent, and we asked to be transferred to a supervisor. XXXX XXXX both faxed and emailed documentation that Loan Care requested. 

With each question the XXXX XXXX representative and I asked, more obstacles were presented by the agent, couldn't be refunded to the bank, had to be sent by check, takes a minumum of 10 days, fax might not be found, delay delay, etc., etc. To say the process was frustrating was an understatement. 

The Supervisor eventually found the information XXXX XXXX sent and started a new "" ticket '' number XXXX. At the end of the call, however, we felt that the new ticket would be resolved. 

That was 2 and 1/2 weeks ago, and NO communication has come from Loan care. They have refused to return the overpayment. I notified them on the XXXX that if I did not have the refund by XX/XX/XXXX I would be contact the CFPB. That didn't phase them one little bit.

Each time I call, whether it's to gain access to my account or just attempt to close it and have the funds in my account mailed to me in a check, I am told that nothing can be done until I receive a letter, which is absolutely absurd.

My money is in this bank account, and i have no way of accessing it, nor closing my account, and Citibank refuses to assist me outside of mentioning a letter, that I have yet to receive after almost 2 weeks.

As of right now, I still have zero access to my account ( online banking ) or the money in it. I am being told to wait on a letter to arrive via USPS mail, that should have been here by now, and is still not here. We are in the middle of a pandemic, and I can not access my account nor can I close it."
Mortgage,"SLS Specialized Loan Serving is my mortgage service provider. 

I reached out to them back in XX/XX/XXXX to inform them I was directly effected by the Covid-19. 

They gave me a 6 month forbearance and then I asked for another extension and they gave an additional 3 months which brings my account due for payment XX/XX/XXXX I called to Make my XXXX payment and they mentioned the past balance plus my XXXX payment was due immediately and I explained we are senior citizens on a fixed income and couldnt afford to make that lump payment and asked if the past due balance could be moved to the end of our loan and we were ready to make our one month XX/XX/XXXX payment. 

They mentioned we would need to fill out documentation but to me it looked just like a traditional loan application and we were not told in the beginning that this would be a requirement to get the past amount moved to the end of the loan. 

I asked if we could have another extension that President Biden extended for all people who were effected by the Covid 19 and the rep mentioned they dont know anything about that and he just became President a few weeks ago. 

This is causing more stress on my husband and I we are elderly and we are trying to stay healthy and just want to pay our mortgage and have the balance that we owe put on the end. 

I feel like they arent operating under the Cares Act and need to follow the guidelines Thanks"

Once I paid the fee and competed the application process, my loan officer stopped communicating with me over the phone. What little phone communication I did have my officer ( XXXX XXXX ) kept telling me my loan was "" 100 percent complete '' and he didn't need anything else from me. Then I would get email requests for insurance documents. The documents requested were confusing and unfamiliar to me. When I would call to ask questions, he wouldn't answer the phone or return my calls. When I finally did speak to him, he again would say he didn't need anything else and to ignore the requests for documents. Often after speaking, I would get an email from his "" assistant XXXX '' asking for the documents he just told me he didn't need. This went on for a few weeks, until I responded to "" XXXX '' ( who never spoke to me or answered questions and who I think was a robo ) that I had just spoken to XXXX who told me again to ignore the document requests and I was tired of going around in circles with them over the documents they wanted but wouldn't answer questions about. Right after that my loan status was changed to "" cancelled '' without explaination. I lost my {$500.00} application fee to uncooperative finance company. Amerisave Mortgage are unethical thieves."
Debt collection,"A collection agency called IQ DATA INT'L INC  ( XXXX XXXX XXXX WA XXXX XXXX ) placed for collection a charge of {XXXX} from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Georgia  ( original creditor ) on XX/XX/XXXX.

I noticed this on XX/XX/XXXX as I was trying to apply for some credit. Since, XXXX of XXXX, I have filed a fraud report with the FTC and the CFPB. Have not heard anything from either agency regarding my case. 
Back to the crux of the matter, WE called IQ DATA in XXXX XXXX and asked them what we needed to do. A very respectful man XXXX XXXX told us to mail documentation to IQ DATA verifying my place of residence during the fraudulent charger, who used the the name XXXX XXXX not me XXXX XXXXXXXX to navigate their fraudulent account at this apartment complex. I did this, I mailed the documentation w/ proof of residency, drivers lis proving AGAIN my address which was not in Georgia . So, it is NOW XXXX and WE have not heard anything from IQ DATA INT'L. I called on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke to XXXX XXXX. Mr.XXXX proceeded to say to me "" so why don't you just pay the XXXX bill '', the nerve of this person to assume I was the fraudulent person before IQ DATA even completed their "" investigation ''. He next proceeded in a very unprofessional manner to tell me these investigations take 2, 3 and even 6 months. If this is the kind of people IQ DATA employees WOW I guess the fraudulent account from XXXX will never come off my report. I was living in XXXX XXXX Florida during the dates the fraud ( person ) was living under my identity in Georgia, It stated that on the copy of the lease I sent to IQ DATA and on my drivers Lis and a utility bill. The fact of the matter is my identity was stolen and IQ DATA keeps trying to implicate me as the fraudulent person. When the facts clearly prove otherwise. 
Perhaps, I should ask my attorney to get involved, because I'm sure with the evidence in hand any judge would see the FACTS."

I have always tried my best to get every single payment in on time, however there were a few times in the past that I was late. Ever since then, I have been a great customer and have even paid early a few times. With the exception of those few late payments, my track record for paying on time has been great.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I have become aware that that the credit reporting agencies may not be in compliance with certain provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act XXXX FCRA XXXX and how it is reporting my credit information. 

In accordance of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) : 605. Requirements relating to information contained in consumer reports [ 15 U.S.C. 1681c ] ( a ) Information excluded from consumer reports. Except as authorized under subsection ( b ) of this section, no consumer reporting agency may make any consumer report containing any of the following items of information : ( 1 ) Cases under title 11 [ United States Code ] or under the Bankruptcy Act that, from the date of entry of the order for relief or the date of adjudication, as the case may be, antedate the report by more than 10 years.

604. Permissible purposes of consumer reports [ 15 U.S.C. 1681b ] ( a ) In general. Subject to subsection ( c ), any consumer reporting agency may furnish a consumer report under the following circumstances and no other : ( 1 ) In response to the order of a court having jurisdiction to issue such an order, or a subpoena issued in connection with proceedings before a Federal grand jury.

( 2 ) In accordance with the written instructions of the consumer to whom it relates.

With subsections 604 and 605, the credit reporting agencies did not get the information of my bankruptcy from the State of Tennessee nor did I express that information to be made public in any expressed written agreement or statement. The three credit reporting agencies received my personal credit information from public records which they are not in compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act.

Fair Credit Reporting Act states the regulation and laws that govern the three credit reporting agencies, however the misuse of personal information for financial gain harms consumers. I could not find a place to stay because that was on my credit report and reduce my score.

They keep transferring the servicer, and now in XXXX they sold servicing to XXXX  and now I receive a statemetn that my equity is CHARGED OFF, even though I have been paying them the required amount of XXXX a month as I was negotiated this with previous representative. 

This is the SECOND TIME, I am going thru this. Furthermore, my balance should be reduced by all these XXXX payments and NOT increasing. This is not a negative amortazation loan."

I tried reaching out to PROCOLLECT and even wrote them a letter for the 30 day dispute ; they just hang up. They say it does not matter and I have to pay or else they will -threaten to do something else-. There is no way to communicate with them and make them investigate this claim. I do not think it's fair that this is affecting my credit score, showing up, and they are making me pay a debt that is clearly not mine. I am a student, I can't afford to be paying off this kind of debt that does not belong to me. And that is negatively affecting my future. I need someone to make the agency at least investigate the debt, in order to confirm that it's not a debt under my name. Something they are not willing to do."

On Transunion and XXXX it shows 120 days past due and on XXXX  it shows 90 days past due. If all of this information is produced from the same place and sent to all three bureaus why is it incorrect?

Mortgage,"On XX/XX/XXXX we closed on a refinancing with Eagle Bank for our single family home in XXXX MD. 

On XX/XX/XXXX we were informed that our loan had been sold to US Bank. The effective date of US Bank to start receiving payments was XX/XX/XXXX. Our loan number is XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I was informed by email that USBank had disbursed {$1900.00} to XXXX XXXX for an insurance premium payout. 

Unfortunately, we do not have our homeowner 's insurance with XXXX XXXX. We have our insurance with XXXX 's and this payment was made by Eagle Bank on XX/XX/XXXX. 

In speaking with the poorly trained customer service department, I was informed that US Bank made a payment for the premium for the Master insurance policy for the Condo.

This property is not a Condominium, it is a single family home which could be easily checked by using XXXX or perhaps just reading the documents. 

Even if this was a condo, what Condo owner pays the premium for the Master Insurance Policy for the Association? The only premium a Condo owner would pay is for an HO6 policy.

The rep then asked me if my policy covered walls in or just the outside. Again, this is a single family home so this question shows a poor understanding of what is in a Condo policy vs a single family home policy. 

The rep found that my paperwork was processed incorrectly designating it as a Condo. Why that happened and what possessed anyone to send a payment for a premium for a Master policy when you aren't even processing my payments yet for the mortgage is unbelievable. 

We are very disturbed that you would send funds out of our account when you do not even have the account till XX/XX/XXXX. 

I spoke with a rep for US Bank on XX/XX/XXXX and was assured my paperwork would be updated and the funds returned to my account. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received an email that US Bank has now sent another payment for homeowners insurance for {$1900.00} to XXXX XXXX. Still not our homeowners insurance policy. Called the bank on XXXX and they had no record of my request from XX/XX/XXXX. I asked for a lock on any more escor payments and that they had t get my authorization. They refused. I am now out {$3900.00} with no assurances when this money will be returned. I emailed XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX at the Bank with no response. 

US Bank has shown us so far very sloppy handling of our account, our funds and very poorly trained workers. Not what you want to see when you handle our escrow for insurance and taxes."

I contacted Citibank to see what accommodation could reasonably be made in the term of a account credit or mailing a check that can be negotiated through my bank. They refused to make any accommodation, and stated that as a matter of policy, they were requiring individuals to go into the store to cash their check. During Covid they shouldve made a reasonable accommodation to my XXXX, this policy is both unfair and abusive. Citibank has many alternatives available to them to provide relief to the consumer and allow them access to their much-needed funds. I do believe that this deceptive policy has been put in place to limit the payouts under this program as the funds will expire at the end of 2021. I asked them for an accommodation and they refused, I further asked them to register my complaint for their internal system. I asked if it were possible for a family member who I designated with appropriate ID, I could make this transaction for me and they stated that I had to be there in person. There is no ability to retrieve my funds without my physical presence inside their store I asked for an escalation of this problem to a superior, and they said there was no escalation opportunity.

Under section 616 of the FCRA Transunion is required to supply proof and method of their investigation. Transunion has yet to abide by the law. This blazing attack on my credit worthiness has caused me great financial harm. Therefore, I'm giving one final goodwill reach our before suing under section 616 Transunion also claimed to CFPB that they need approval for account due to me listing another source on the complaint. This is not true and Transunion has again used another stall tactic in order to circumvent the law. Transunion has full authority to access my account just as much as they have allowed an erroneous account to be reported without any true verification. 

This is another stall tactic used by Transunion to willfully break the law. Transunion has had ample time to correct this erroneous information.

I request that Tranunion send this document from their address showing proof that Transunion has in possession of any document baring my signature. I do not consent to any form of electronic investigation using XXXX XXXX or any other data collecting firms that also have erroneous information.

They told me that I could not do a loan modification, Deed-in-lieu, Short-sale, or refinance. Different told me different things when I called the M & T Bank Mortgage department so options were told that they were unavailable to me and then they were, or I was too late because of the misinformation. I hired 3 different estate agents who listed the house. I had 2 people who made offers to buy the property for a percentage but, the bank refused saying that it was not enough. one offer was for {$18000.00} and the other was for {$30000.00}. Agents told me that many people didn't put in offers because the garage that is located near the property did not come with the house. So with no acceptable offers, the property went into foreclosure and in XX/XX/XXXX it was sold for {$24000.00}. The mortgage never included the garage located near the property but, as of XX/XX/XXXX, there was a survey completed showing that the garage is actually part of the property. The garage was never insured and only used 1 stall of the garage being that the other stall was used by the owner of other property, and believed to be owned by the owner of other nearby property that shares driveway next to the property. The power is connected to the other property. The garage was never included on the mortgage or appraisal for the mortgage. M & T Bank did not work with me or provide accurate information regarding workout options which have resulted in foreclosure on my credit report and preventing me from getting another home for me and my family."

Mortgage,"On XX/XX/XXXX, Lakeview Loan Servicing LLC made a "" Principal Balance Adjustment '' to my mortgage account in the amount of {$8500.00}. This amount appears as a "" Deferred Balance '' on my mortgage statements beginning in XX/XX/XXXX. This balance adjustment was made in error, as confirmed by two separate customer service representatives whom I spoke with over the phone on XX/XX/XXXX. At that time, I was assured that the error would be corrected within 2-3 business days. As of XX/XX/XXXX, there has been no resolution and subsequent attempts to contact Lakeview Loan Servicing - both by phone and via their customer support web form - have been ignored. 

Background : From XX/XX/XXXX thru XX/XX/XXXX, my mortgage was on forbearance due to the pandemic. When my forbearance ended on XX/XX/XXXX, I paid the entire 6 month forbearance balance ( {$14000.00} ) in full. According to the customer service representatives that I spoke to on XX/XX/XXXX, Lakeview Loan Servicing LLC mistakenly deferred principal balance from the forbearance period, despite the fact that I had just paid the balance in full. As shown in the attached Payment History, the principal balance adjustment was made the same day on which I ended my forbearance and paid the 6-month balance. 

I have attached a copy of the 12-month payment history for this loan, including mortgage statements. The unexplained/errant Principal Balance Adjustment appears in the XXXX statement as "" Deferred Balance '' and appears in the Payment History on XX/XX/XXXX."

Checking or savings account,"Please refer to my previous CFPB complaints about this matter : XXXX and XXXX I had opened a Checking account with BB & T during XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX. I have setup the direct deposit also. I have no idea why BB & T has blocked my online access? As during COVID-19 me and my spouse is working remotely ( from home ) as well as helping the kids during their online schooling. It seems BB & T called and my spouse picked up up the call - but he was in a meeting and I was also in the meeting. I tried to call back BB & T at XXXX but there is so many confusing menus and no way to reach out a human being. Worse thing - during this pandemic - this bank is giving tough time to it's customers - by blocking their online access for no good reasons. Moreover My XXXX payment request is also blocked or stopped. I want full access to my BB & T and freedom to use my account - as end of the this is my money and I need to have the access during this testing times. 
For this I filed a CFPB complaint. Seems to be the case that CFPB is a toothless agency with no powers. CFPB merely forwards the message and do nothing. 
I got the worst possible response from this bank : Neither they will unblock the account nor they will close my bank account and send the balance to me. It seems to me that this BB & T is not a bank but some militia who has their own set of rules. 

Neither they will unblock the account nor they will close my bank account and send the balance to me."

Mortgage,"After declining to pursue a refinance with New American Funding, a representative sent an email requesting details why I chose not to pursue the loan, and included approximately 50 other customers on the same email, seeking the same information from them.

In my case, I went nearly a year and half until I noticed the negative reporting by this time there has been instrumental damage to my credit worthiness. What is equally alarming, when the CRAs fail to conduct a independent investigations and the outcomes turn out to be "" certified '' without surveilling the full scope.

I have contacted the bureaus to fix this however, I have not been successful. It is a violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act to not report accurate information on a credit report. This negative reporting is harming my credit score and this line item needs to be removed from my credit report."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",I contacted XXXX XXXX and TransUnion online and I also sent out my credit report along with my dispute and supporting documentation via Certified Mail. It is pass 30 days and I still haven't gotten a response. Section 609 of the FCRA states that you must investigate my dispute within 30 calendar days from my initial letter. As they have failed to do so. I sent my first dispute letters via mail XX/XX/XXXX and I sent my follow up letters XX/XX/XXXX via mail. Please help me correct this issue. Thanks
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","This is my last option before I escalate this matter through the legal system. I have been attempting to remove fraudulent accounts from my credit report since XX/XX/2020 and for a process that should take no longer than 30 days, it has been over 240 days and I have neither received any investigation confirmation nor any result notices. The funny thing is, even the inaccurate personal information that was requested to be corrected, hasn't been done so. The fraud accounts are still showing on my report and it seems the bureaus are perfectly fine with violating my rights under the FCRA and the federal law. As stated, this is the last option before a lawsuit option is pursued."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",I received a copy of my credit report and found the following items to be errors. I've been trying to submit my disputes to the credit bureaus but they seem to be ignoring my complaints.
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","There is a Derogatory Public Record or Collection Filed note on all three of the Credit Reporting agencies. 

I have no knowledge of any collection being filed. 
Previous collection file was due to an error through a debt consolidation company and the hospital they were attempting to pay - but the collection was dropped."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Sometime on XXXX, 2020, after I went to a mortgage company, trying to buy a house, I found out that multiple collection accounts were on my credit report that I had not idea of. There was also a BANKRUPTCY chapter XXXX that I never filed. On XX/XX/2020, I started my first dispute with the credit bureaus to remove the accounts that were not mine ( including the Bankruptcy ). After a few disputes I got some letters from the credit bureaus requesting a Police Report, so, on XX/XX/2020, I went to file a Police Report. With the police report in my hands, after a few times of mailing to the Credit Bureaus, XXXX  and TRANSUNION finally removed the accounts from my report. 
Unfortunately, I am still dealing with an alleged BANKRUPTCY CHAPTER XXXX on my report. So I am now contacting the CFPB because I need this public record out of my credit report, because it is affecting me a lot."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",I CONTACTED XXXX XXXX XXXX ABOUT AN ACCOUNT ON MY CREDIT REPORT THAT I DIDNT AUTHORIZE. I SPOKE TO XXXX XXXX AND EXPLAINED THAT I DIDNT AUTHORIZE ANYONE TO OPEN AN ACCOUNT IN MY NAME FOR SECURITY SYSTEM. WE SPOKE ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS ABOUT THE ACCOUNT AND I ASKED FOR ANY PAPERWORK THAT VALIDATES THE ACCOUNT OR ORIGINAL PAPERWORK ALLOWING THEM TO COLLECT A DEBT FROM ME. MR XXXX WAS SUPPOSE TO EMAIL ME THE DOCUMENTS ON 2 OCCASIONS BUT I STILL HAVENT RECEIVED THEM AS OF NOW. SO I AM FILING THIS COMPLAINT IN ORDER TO GET MY CREDIT IN ORDER. I AM ATTACHING THE ACTUAL LETTER THAT I SENT TO XXXX XXXX XXXX AND THE DOCUMENTATION THAT I ASKED FOR. I EXPLAINED TO MR. XXXX THAT IF HE COULD PROVIDE THOSE DOCUMENTS THAT I COULD HANDLE THE MATTER DIRECTLY WITH PROTECT AMERICA. I AM FILING THIS REPORT ID THEFT BECAUSE HE SAID THAT THERE WAS OVER A YEAR OF PAYMENTS MADE TO THIS ACCOUNT. I HAVE NEVER SENT ANY MONEY TO XXXX XXXX  OR XXXX XXXX XXXX. ANY TRANSACTIONS ARE A RESULT OF IDENITY THEFT.
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",I recently checked my credit report and noticed fraudulent accounts on my credit report.I reached out to the creditor to request the accounts to be removed and they have not removed it. These are fraudulent accounts and need to be removed immediately.
Debt collection,"I requested services on XX/XX/2020 for telephone and internet services for a new home that I purchased. I was told that the router for the internet and the services would begin on XX/XX/2020. I did not receive service nor any equipment, I contacted XXXX, a technician was sent to my new home on XX/XX/2020 and the technician could not get any connection for service, he told me he would put a ticket in to cancel the service, I called XXXX on XX/XX/2020 and was told that the ticket was in and the account was closed. I received a bill from XXXX via the XXXX app at the end of XXXX 2020, and immediately contacted XXXX and was informed to disregard that bill, the paper bill will be {$00.00}. I now receive notification from a collection company who is trying to collect {$31.00} for services that I have never received. I contacted XXXX and each time I am transferred to the collection company. Today I went on the XXXX Chat line with their representative and I have a part of her message below ''. 
"" thank you for waiting, i was able to check the account, please disregard the bill you received, no balance on this account i will create a ticket for you to stop receive bill ofr this account '' I have been getting the run around since XX/XX/2020. Please help me resolve this dispute. Thanks"
Debt collection,"Due to financial hardships, I decided to turn in a car I could no longer afford. The car was returned to the lending company and an agreement made to pay monthly payments in the amount of {$50.00}. A few months into the arrangement, I was asked to increase my payments. I refused because I did not want to agree to a payment I could not afford. Therefore I continued making payments until XX/XX/2019. In XXXX of XXXX the company stop accepting my payments. My online account was disabled and I was told by a collection representative that payments were no longer being accepted and they were pursuing another means of collecting the payment. I tried for several weeks to speak with a supervisor. I was talked to in a very unprofessional manner from several representatives to include the supervisor. I asked for statements and records of my account and was never sent that information. In XXXX I received an email from my HR department notifying me of a garnishment for this account. Days later I received a letter from the company about the garnishment. I attempted to appeal the decision and make several settlement offers but each offer was denied and countered with an amount not much less than the balance this company claim I owed. I've since attempted to offer a settlement but again was countered with an amount not much less than one of the balances this company has reported I owed. The amount the company says I owe is always higher than the amount reported to the credit bureau."
Checking or savings account,"I am a stay at home mom, who doesnt work and Bank Of America lied to me and contradicts everything they tell me. 

on XXXX of XXXX I called Bank of America in regards of my account. The representative explained to me he saw some charges on my account. I replied and said I didnt authorize those charges. 

The rep then stated he will submit a refund and within 90 days they will CONTACT THE MERCHANT and after contacting the merchant, they will then make a decision before closing the case. 

On XX/XX/XXXX of XXXX, BANK OF AMERICA reversed the refund which resulted my account being overdraft and they charge me an overdraft fee. ( {$69.00} was the refund ). I then received my stimulus check and because they took back the refund they gave me, my account was in the NEGATIVES and BANK OF AMERICA gave me a credit so My account will be positive again so I can get my full stimulus check. ( if they contacted the merchant and verified the merchant was already paid by my bf, then none of this would of happened ) the temporary credit was for {$43.00} which will end on XX/XX/XXXX ( all of this because no one reached out to the merchant and they caused my account to be in the negatives ) called Bank of America and was told, they NEVER CONTACTED the merchant because there was no urgency. I explained thats NOT what I was told and I was told they would reach out to the merchant before closing the case. 

I was advised that I would now have to submit my documents so they can reopen the case and that it would take up to 45 days I submitted the documents within one week of speaking to the agent. Then was told within 4 business days they would have a decision.

I called back within 5 business days and then was told 10 business days for a decision. I called back again and now was told 45 days again. ( Everyone keeps giving me new days of when this will be resolved ) Now XX/XX/XXXX is close and they will take back the credit of {$43.00} which will make my account go in the NEGATIVES again while they research the claim. For some reason no one can listen to all the calls I made where every agent in the claims department provided different information to me that contradicts what the last person said. And now Bank of America owes me {$69.00} and wants me to pay {$43.00} because of the overdraft fee they caused in my account. 


I was NEVER advised back in XXXX that they needed any documents! No one reached out and explained that I could of faxed them the documents, I only faxed them my documents because the case was reopen since they closed it!"
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","XXXX was given permission to run my credit ( in-house ) for the purpose of providing an auto loan ( XX/XX/19 ). 
XXXX  ran my credit again ( and without my knowledge or permission ) nearly 14 days ( XX/XX/19 ) after the terms of the loan were established."
Debt collection,"On XX/XX/2020 I XXXX XXXX made a phone call to XXXX XXXX XXXX to take care of a debt that I incurred from XXXX XXXX XXXX in the amount of {$850.00}. At the time of speaking with the debt collector they set me up with two separate payments which was requested by me. On XX/XX/2020 I made a payment of {$420.00} and then of XX/XX/2020 I made the second payment via an auto draft from my bank account of {$420.00}. On XX/XX/2020 when I made the first payment I asked the debt collector representative that was taking my payment that once I made the final payment would there be something sent to the creditors on my behalf to remove or delete as that was what I requested and they said yes once the final payment had been received. They also informed me that they will automatically mail me out a letter stating that it had been paid in full. Once I made the final payment on XXXX XXXX and I did not receive anything in mail after a week I called the debt collector and asked them why I had not received anything in mail and thats when they told me that I had toc all and request that. I explained that the last representative that I spoke with did not tell me that I needed to call in however, she stated that it was something that they automatically did. To my surprise I did not get accurate information. Also, to have it removed or deleted the representative told me that it was something that was available upon request which I did request However, only to find out that this has not been removed or deleted from my credit. The last report showed that it was indeed paid in full but also as an active account which is not the truth. According to my research this is a UDAAP violation when there is Deceptive Acts of Practice which was very misleading for me and an very unnecessary process to do the things that I need to do."
Mortgage,"This is a continuation of CFPB closed # XXXX. 

As you can clearly see by the evidence presented ( the threatening letter from Rouff Mortgage and page showing my automatic payments made ) I am NOT behind in payments nor do I have any evidence that any were late. 

Auto pay is set up to take the payment out on XXXX of each month to by the XXXX of the next month to always be on time. This is an electronic payment, not mail which might be lost! 

This is nothing short of harrassment to get another extra payment and I am NOT playing that game again! I never received the letter last time but paid that one regardless to be done with it since a corporation can produce anything they want to from a computer but an unsuspecting consumer can not prove they never received it! Refreshing your memory when I phoned the XXXX XXXX office to verify the XXXX due date, they said "" first payment due '' in XXXX is correct and proved my point. 

I am tired of this harrassment. Either XXXX is making an effort to get more free profit, or they can't adequately run their own business."

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I have a major credit card with XXXX XXXX. Recently XX/XX/2021 I entered into an agreement with them for 6 months with this card. The agreement is to pay {$50.00} per month at an interest rate of 5.9 % for the 6 months. I was told on XX/XX/2021 that I need to make the first inital payment of {$50.00} which I did with the rep. Going forward I also agreed to have the payments come out of my account each month. I confirmed that the account would be considered in good standing and current. I was assured "" yes ''. On XX/XX/2021 I received a text that the account is past due. I immediately called XXXX XXXX and was told that I need to make another {$20.00} payment. I made the {$20.00} payment. I asked why is the account reporting now as late when I was assured after I made the {$50.00} payment the account would be considered current. I would have paid the {$70.00} if that is what they were requiring to go into this program on that day instead of the account showing as late. I am upset at the fact that I might be charged a late fee and in addition that it's going to be reported to the credit reporting agency 's again. I have been disputing with them about 2 negative remarks that are already reporting when in fact I went through this with them back in XXXX when the pandemic hit."

I demand these accounts be deleted immediately or I will file litigation due to the stress you cause me.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",I FILED A DISPUTE WITH THE CREDIT REPORTING AGENCIES IN REGARDS TO INACCURATE INFORMATION REPORTING ON MY CREDIT REPORTS. I NEVER RECEIVED ANY NOTIFICATION IN REGARDS TO THE INVESTIGATION RESULTS.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Hi ***SEE ATTACHMENTS WITH SUPPORTING DOCUMENTS**** I was reviewing my credit again early this morning and notice that you continue to report incomplete and misleading information on my personal info, old addresses thats not required by fcra, variatios of misspelled names, phone numbers, and inconsistencies with the 3 accounts below. 

Its my understanding that youre company or organization needs to keep solid and 100 % accurate information on my credit and anything otherwise, its a violation of fcra and consumer laws. These accounts and negative info is NOT in COMPLIANT with the laws and they need to be removed. Its impossible that you actually investigated these accounts because they are still reporting different dates of last active, different dates of last payment, different payment status and history, etc. 

How is it possible that one credit bureau deletes the item or stated that I paid one-time and never late, but you continue to report inconsistent and incomplete information? How come I disputed these accounts before, but the account status was never updated.?!? How come nothing legally was sent to me to verify the account? Saying that you verified this account as accurate, is a binding legal agreement that you follow all the protocols. Well, you didnt because its still showing those negative things on my credit and Ive ccd cfpb and ftc on this matter. I demand that you delete them all ( XXXX ; XXXX XXXX ; XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX"
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","XX/XX/XXXX I returned a XXXX XXXX XXXX as instructed by XXXX. XXXX had performed a preinspection and noted several minor repairs I should have completed before turn-in. I followed their direction and left all the documentation in the car front seat. XXXX still charged me for all the repairs. After several phone calls and multiple resubmissions of the documented receipts and pictures, XXXX finally removed most of the charges. I paid the lease termination fee of {$300.00} and a lost key for {$250.00} but XXXX continued to send me invoices each month. As you can see in the attached XXXX report the balance changed almost monthly for no apparent reason or without any clear itemization. 

Finally, XXXX claimed that the roughly {$390.00} was for personal property tax. Since the State of VA prorates I ask XXXX to send me a statement of the tax record. They didn't send anything other than non-informational monthly statements. recently my credit score took a big hit 100+ points. After investigating I found that XXXX had charged off {$2800.00} dollars. 

I have escalated this to a supervisor who claims there is nothing they can do, I ask the supervisor who would not provide his name or case/claim number. I ask for the supervisor I was speaking with for the 3rd time and he said "" she '' would call me. I have received no call. 

I ask XXXX to update the credit bureaus with the status of the account has been paid in full. XXXX agrees it's been paid in full but refuses to report this to the bureaus or have the {$2800.00} charge off. 

This was a 3-year lease. Not a single payment was ever late. 

Hoping you can help me. I have Federal Government clearances and that charge off could prevent me from obtaining future clearances to provide assistance to our Federal clients. I explained the serious nature of this to XXXX they didn't seem to care. Thank you for any help you can provide."

Mortgage,"A letter to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau I pay a Mortgage to Wells Fargo bank. 
When the pandemic started Last XXXX. I was not having a problem with making my mortgage payments. But in XXXX the first part of XXXX. I was informed by Wells Fargo that i could enter into a forbearance program. That my missed payments could be deferred until the end of my regular Mortgage period. I was also told If I did not want My mortgage payments to increase. that i could pay an extra amount to the escrow So that my payment would not increase. So i started paying at least {$650.00} a month. In total i have sent {$4300.00} to the Escrow department at Wells Fargo. My regular payment was {$1300.00}. 
Now in XXXX I informed them that i would try to resume paying my mortgage. I am a retired XXXX XXXX. So i really don't have a full time job. So I am making it with the amount I regularly pay. But i could do better if the payment was a little lower. 
But I was just informed that my new payment would be {$1600.00} I am devastated to hear that even though I have paid about {$4300.00} in to escrow that my payment increases Anyway. as If i had paid nothing. My mortgage is an FHA loan., And i Tried to do what was right."
Vehicle loan or lease,"When I leased my vehicle I signed a contract for XXXX per year and at the end of my lease I was billed for XXXX per year so instead of owing XXXX XXXX I owed XXXX XXXX but my contract said I signed to pay for XXXX per year ... after looking over my contract I noticed that I have two copies one that says dealers copy and one that says leasees copy, none of the numbers match!!! I told the dealership this, they blew me off I told the titling company this and they said there was nothing they could do because they were just using the contract that XXXX XXXX XXXX had submitted to them. I showed my new dealership and they suggested I get a lawyer because the contract was messed up!! I never once missed a payment with them before and the lawyer that I had spoke to told me to try to negotiate with the company first. So even though the company had been XXXX XXXX, and very inconvenient over the phone and email, I decided it was best for me to drive there, even though its 2hours for me to get there ... I spoke with XXXX XXXX, and a guy named XXXX, and asked that someone from fianc would be available and if I would be able to see XXXX XXXX They both had said yes, and so at the start of COVID I drove out there to clear this up. The guy went in circles claiming the contract was clear as day but then claiming it make no sense that the numbers did not match on both copies, then told me I should not even have a copy of the dealers copy, I said why so I wouldnt know you were trying to get over on me?!? He then asked to have the copy and told me there wasnt anything I could do, I told him I wanted to speak to the XXXX he said he was the head of finance, and that he was sorry that I wasted my time driving out there. I told him I wasnt leaving until I talked to XXXX XXXX, and he said sorry he just left!! Then because of COVID my lawyer was not getting back to me! And I thought because of the pandemic it could have been postponed because I never once received a phone call or letter about the money after XXXX! Then when I called the titling company to make a payment I was told my account was closed. I thought maybe they had figured it out! Then I went to buy my house only to find they put it in as a charge off dropouts my credit over XXXX points!! This is ridiculous for me to be punished for their mistake, and I dont just have {$4.00} extra grand to pay a car company that filed paperwork wrong!! I had a credit score in the XXXX before and this disheartening especially in these times!"
Debt collection,There was an account that was opened through pro collect from XXXX XXXX XXXX for the amount of XXXX on the date of XX/XX/2014. Pro collect contacted me multiple times about this account and let them know that i do not owe this account. Ive sent paperwork showing i do not owe these amounts i even tried disputing it.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX  did not respond or finish my accounts investigation on time as of XX/XX/2020, this company received my dispute yet has failed to mail me any response first of all this alleged account XXXX is not reporting to XXXX XXXX Reporting standards and violates the fair credit reporting act by failing to complete an investigation in a timely manner and failing to ensure maximum possible accuracy before furnishing this account The XXXX Credit Bureaus also report this account with Multiple errors and incomplete data"
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","My complaint involves Bank of America reporting a closed savings or checking account ( I believe ) for suspected fraud activity although I have reported to them that this account is not mine and must be the result of ID theft. When I found out about this reporting I alerted XXXX  via online dispute and Bank of America sent a one page internal screenshot of a form with my name typed into it. So XXXX  marked as verified although I am not sure how that verified anything. Subsequently, I called Bank of America and after several hours I finally got to report the account as fraudulent and I was sent a Uniform ID Theft form to be filled out, signed, and returned with a copy of my ID ; which I did. A couple of weeks later I receive a letter from Bank of America saying that no ID theft was detected and this blemish remains on my consumer reports ( i.e. XXXX, XXXX, etc. ) although Bank of America has amended to include SETTLED IN FULL in the Closure Status line. How is this legal, moral, just, or ethical? Bank of America has yet to tell me why this was even suspected of fraudulent activity. All I have received from them is that one page mentioned earlier. Nothing that I signed, no real account info, nor any kind of insight into why they are refusing to remove this against proper procedure and various consumer protection laws. I have been forced to postpone the opening of a law practice and other business ventures due to this incorrect and fraudulent reporting. I can not obtain a proper business bank account and take advantage of business banking offers, etc. Moreover ( and more importantly ), I have no chance at being able to open an XXXX account for my law practice, thus costing me substantially. Not to mention as an attorney and seeking employment, having a suspected fraud negatively reporting on my consumer reports is long dead end road that I did not even know I was on. I have even sent Bank of America a verification page that my info/data was stolen in the XXXX Data Breach of 2017 among other numerous data breaches. This account is not, was not, and will never be mine. I don't know what else to do to get Bank of America to understand this. It seems to be some one of those internally started accounts probably for some promo for sales people or something. I DON'T KNOW! ALL I DO KNOW IS I ( THE PERSON THEY ARE NEGATIVELY REPORTING IT AGAINST ) HAD NOR HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT AND IT'S NOT RIGHT THAT THIS BIG BANK WHO GLADLY RECEIVED OUR BAILOUT FUNDS CAN NOT HAVE PROPER PROCEDURES IN PLACE TO ENSURE THESE THINGS DON'T HAPPEN AND WHEN THEY DO MAKE SURE THEY ARE NIPPED IN THE BUD AND NOT AFFECTING THE LIVES OF EVERYDAY PEOPLE JUST TRYING TO MAKE IT. IT'S DISGRACEFUL, DISGUSTING, SHAMEFUL, AND UNJUST"

You have failed to conduct a truthful investigation into this PUBLIC RECORD by the consumer laws. NOT IN COMPLIANT!

Between the application fee and the closing costs, the lender has {$3900.00} of my money. 

I've done two other refinances and they were both simple and fast. This has been completely unacceptable."
Mortgage,"My wife and I chose Wells Fargo because they were able to match a great rate to refinance my home mortgage. They are also the current holder of my home mortgage. Throughout the process, I was told repeatedly that the "" Other Costs '' associated with my refinance would be waived ( {$0.00} ) because I am already a Wells Fargo customer. This gave them a significant edge over the other lender quotes I received. I received this correspondence multiple times throughout this refinance process ( XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX ). 

Well, it is now time to close ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and those fees are still there. I am now out an appraisal fee and 3 months of correspondence. I have made it known that I will not be going through with the refinance if those fees are included on my loan since the beginning, so this should not be a surprise to anyone I have talked to at Wells Fargo. I am receiving the response of "" There is nothing we can do '', which is just not good enough for me. I should not be penalized for incorrect information.

I have not received a response from them yet. I feel like I'm being ignored by them of my disputes. This are deceptive practices by the bureaus."
Checking or savings account,"My checking account with M & T bank has been compromised by XXXX twice in less than three months. It started on XX/XX/XXXX for {$.00}, {$1.00}, and {$19.00}. I was able to report and to leave email telling them to remove the charges but I was upset because M & T had nothing on its menu or online to report fraud. 

On XX/XX/XXXX an XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX hit my account for {$.00} and {$3.00}. Again I tried to contact M & T to no avail. Because Covid, reaching customer Service was impossible. I spent hours trying to reach them for over a week! I tried continuously and was really upset because my social security check is deposited in this same checking account! 
Finally, I called my local branch and a one of the female employee returned my call and resolved the issues. I told her what had happened. 
I received my stimulus check direct deposited into this same account. The check for {$600.00} I never received. I went to the IRS website and saw that I qualified. One suggestion on the IRS website said to ask your bank if they.received the funds. 
No answer. 
My mother who is XXXX also has an account with M & T. She wrote a check to a charity in XX/XX/XXXX. It was cashed later at XXXX XXXX XXXX and changed from {$100.00} to {$7600.00} in XXXX. M & T told use because it was check fraud, it would take 90 days to return her funds. When we called back in 90 days, M & T stated their investigator was on vacation and it would be handles upon his return. Nothing happened. No money went back into my Mom 's account. 
Last week, an investigator from XXXX XXXX called and asked us about the case. M & T had lied to us. They had never done an investigation!! In two days, my mom had her money back. since XX/XX/XXXX!!!!

Credit card or prepaid card,Last XX/XX/2020 I decided I would like to open up a secured card with city card so I gave them {$600.00} and shortly there after the roommate that I was living with stole the card and moved out nowhere to be found. I explained all of this to the overseas fraudulent resolution department at city card and city card in shored me that they were going to completely XXXX out the balance so The {$600.00} security payment that I made would be returned to me since I never once used the card and I want to make that clear upon my conversation with the gentleman in the fraudulent department he said we are going to send you a check and its for {$4.00}. I said wait a minute I gave you {$600.00} as a security deposit never once had a chance to use the card you know it was fraudulent because you wiped off the fees and now youre refusing to give me back my {$600.00} at this point I have my lawyer on retainer and I expect city card to do the right thing and mail me my {$600.00} security deposit from last year not XXXX dollars at this point this is causing me much XXXX  pain and suffering and my attorney said we can include all of that in the litigation so its going to end up costing Citibank much more money and legal fees much more money in additional pay out because were going to sue big if were going to go to court and if you choose to not send me back my money you are stealing from your customers. CFPB this is just another example of big bank taking advantage of the small consumer especially during COVID-19 when many Americans are struggling to put food on them on their table I find this really really disrespectful just tasteful and dishonest.

I spoke with a supervisor at Superfleet and then also to the cancellation department ( account was supposed to have already been cancelled ). The cancellation department ( XXXX XXXX ) informed us that they were aware of NATIONWIDE mail delays from the United States Post Office and this was happening all over.

We purchased the warranty but they state its not covered. We are not claiming a warranty issue but a defective product claim. We requested a chargeback from synchrony with no response to our claims. This is absolutely unacceptable. This has hurt our credit score and we feel that this is very wrong and we have NOT been protected from a very defective and deceptive purchase.

It was granted and they sent me a letter confirming that I was in forbearance for the period XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, and all foreclosure activity would cease. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, my usual statement listed attorney 's fees, other foreclosure expenses and my house was listed with XXXX XXXX GA for public auction for XX/XX/XXXX. I contacted SLS at their customer service number and was told that something was wrong because I was in a forbearance agreement. I emailed the bill collector - attorney and explained that I was in forbearance. I wrote the first letter of many to SLS who did nothing but canceled the sale for that date. I complained about them billing me for foreclosure expenses while under the forbearance agreement. In my next statement the legal fees associated with foreclosure were changed to "" corporate advances '' XXXX same amount for each item that was billed in the XX/XX/XXXX statement, and designated as foreclosure activity ). I wrote an overnight letter requesting a full disclosure of what the fees were and under what authority were they placing these corporate advancement fees on my account. The payment department in XXXX XXXX CO sent the letter back to me and told me that their billing office in XXXX CO handled account issues.

I requested an update to my credit reports to reflect the paid off mortgage loan. They updated my credit report to show a current balance of {$30000.00} and the account as closed.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I have two CitiCards. An Awards ( ... XXXX ) card and a CitiAdvantage Card ( ... XXXX ) Sometime in early 2020, before XXXX, my card ending in XXXX, that I had not used for over 5 years was paid off complete. 

Payments were being made automatically to both accounts from my XXXX XXXX Checking Account. For some reason after the paying off my card ending in XXXX, my payments to card XXXX ( CitiAdvantage ) were being applied to my XXXX card. I discovered this error and contacted Citi, who promised to move the credit in XXXX to XXXX and update my payment history accordingly. Citi moved the credit to XXXX on XX/XX/2020, or thereabouts, but never updated my payment history as promised. As a result I immediately received a 60-90 past due on my credit report, which I did not know of until recently. 

Furthermore, my card ending in XXXX had received activity that was fraudulent after the XXXX correction. I never received a statement or notification in the mail about any activity. The disputed amount was reported to the credit agencies as still past due as recently as XX/XX/2021, however upon notifying Citi, their fraud department and customer service departments tell me that I have a negative {$35.00} balance ( credit ). 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received two letters from Citi ( attached ) stating that my credit information is correct and that I need to contact the credit agencies to let them know I'm disputing the information. 

I spoke with Citi again, XXXX - XXXX PST on XX/XX/2021 and was sent from department to department speaking to representatives in their fraud and customer services department only to be disconnected without resolution. 

I fear this really indicates Citi 's lack of security protocols and their inability to have any oversight to their credit card billing and management systems. Their lack of knowledge about their own processes is grossly expressed as their representatives appear to be mouthpieces to only drive their customers to give up due to their corporate direction of not really caring about their clients concerns. I am sure that I am not the only one going through this exhaustive process to right the wrong due to their negligence. 

I hope this is enough information to start this investigation. 

I plan on re-calling them as soon as send out this statement. 

All of the above can be confirmed if Citi releases all phone recordings and transcripts of my discussions and actions with them since XX/XX/2020. 

I can offer a copy of my credit report if needed. Every other creditor reports exceptional payment history except Citi.

I paid for e-filing of 2 documents which were supposed to be recorded for a business transaction that was to take place in a few months. When I went to close on the transaction, I was unable to and the business transaction was terminated because that documentation was never filed. When I called the company and ask them why they didn't file it, the admin. assistant literally said "" oh I don't know '' but we did get your documents. I then asked for a refund and she said no. I IMMEDIATELY contacted Elan to file the despites. Elan then proceeded to have me explain the situation and further WRITE it down TWICE and mail and fax it in. After going through all of that trouble, they sent me a letter this week saying that they can't do anything about it because my disputes were files after 60 days of the transaction. THE ISSUE DID NOT ARISE UNTIL AFTER 60 DAYS. AND ALSO, WHY WASTE MY TIME AND HAVE ME GO THROUGH ALL OF THIS TROUBLE ONLY YO NOT ASSIST. I NEED MY MONEY BACK. I PAID FOR SERVICES THAT I NEVER GOT AND THIS IS NOT ETHICAL AT ALL."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I submitted formal letters enclosing copies of my SSN card, current state driver 's license both of which contained my correct personal information, including my legal name and correct residential address. These letters were sent from XXXX through XX/XX/2020. 

This information was submitted to XXXX, XXXX and Transunion on numerous occasions, IN WRITING, providing all related documentation to prove my legal name, address, and correct SSN. 

To date, these credit-reporting agencies have REFUSED to remove all erroneous information. THEY ARE REPORTING ADDRESSES OF CITIES AND STATES I HAVE NEVER RESIDED IN AND HAVE NEVER VISITED. THEY ARE REPORTING SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS THAT ARE NOT MINE. THEY ARE REPORTING NAMES THAT I HAVE NEVER USED. NONE OF THESE NAMES ARE MY LEGAL NAME AND DO NOT APPEAR ON MY SSN CARD."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","For almost 4 years I have been complaining regarding a stolen discover card, theft, identity theft, impersonation, and fraudulent payments that allowed the credit limit to be exceeded. I have been denied information that would have proven the fraud such as payment methods used by the thieves and phone conversations. Yesterday I received the attached response from Consumer Financial Protection Bureau stating the account was going to be finally re-investigated and may take up to 90 more days. ( 0 more days is more than 4 years after the fact. I request a speedy investigation by XXXX, XXXX and Transunion. Per the FCRA, the validity, completeness and accurateness should have been accomplished long ago."

Furthermore, it is impossible to get past their chat bot on the website and get actual person to discuss with. It seems like there are no way to upload documents to Citi on the portal either."

Mortgage,"I am being told that I need to pay for another XXXX, but I do not feel as if that is acceptable. Here is the timeline of events and why I believe I should not have to pay for another XXXX : XX/XX/XXXX - I paid for a XXXX  that was completed on this date. 
XX/XX/XXXX - I received a letter stating the value of the property was {$120000.00} and the value needed to be paid down {$8400.00} for the PMI to be removed. 
XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX I received a letter from NewRez stating I will need to submit a written request to have the PMI removed once I paid the value down to below 70 % and that the XXXX was good for 120 days from the completion of the valuation. Since the valuation was completed on XX/XX/XXXX, the valuation would be good until XX/XX/XXXX. 
XX/XX/XXXX - I submitted a check to be applied to PRINCIPAL BALANCE ONLY as noted in the memo line, and in the letter sent with the check. That balance was NOT applied to principal only and I had to call twice to have the corrected. 
XX/XX/XXXX - The principal only payment was corrected and the loan was paid to below {$84000.00}. 
XX/XX/XXXX - I submitted a request in writing to have the PMI removed, AS WELL AS a request to have the escrow removed. I have included the email below that I sent on XX/XX/XXXX. 
XX/XX/XXXX - I called your customer service line and spoke with XXXX who transferred me to the supervisor XXXX. I was told me request for PMI removal would be escalated. 

Since then I have called seven more times ( XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX again and XX/XX/XXXX ). I have spoken with 11 different people ( XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX- supervisor, XXXX , XXXX- Supervisor, XXXX XXXX , XXXX XXXX , XXXX, XXXX- supervisor , XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX ) to find out why my PMI request on XX/XX/XXXX had not been addressed. All 11 of those people stated they would either call me or email me back, and the only one that did is XXXX XXXX who called me back once to tell me she did not have an update for me. 

I paid my loan down to the amount you requested, well within the time frame you asked me to pay it down within, and I submitted a request in writing ( as shown below ) also well within that requested timeframe. Please tell me why I need to pay for another vacation."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I recently, submitted a dispute to XXXX  about the way Jared-Galleria Jewelry is reporting on my credit report. On, XX/XX/XXXX, I received a response back from XXXX stating that Jared-Galleria Jewelry has CERTIFIED AND VERIFIED the information to be "" Accurately '' reporting. I'm confused as to how this account could be VERIFIED AND CERTIFIED TO BE ACCURATE when there are several errors in the way this is being reported : 1 ) XXXX reports that this account was closed "" XX/XX/XXXX '' this is totally a contradiction to how it is being reported in the "" Payment History/Rating ''. Payment History clearly shows that this account was open in XXXX and did not close until the latter of XXXX. Secondly, XXXX reports that the "" High balance '' on this account is {$1400.00}. This totally confuses even the most expert because the credit limit is {$1500.00}. How could the Highest balance be lower then the credit limit? Next, XXXX  fails report the Date of First Delinquency which is required because it helps to identify the purge date. This all leads me to believe that XXXX  did not conduct a reasonable independent investigation. Using XXXX or parroting what a creditor says is not satisfactory for an independent investigation."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","This is my last option before I escalate this matter through the legal system. I have been attempting to remove fraudulent accounts from my credit report since XX/XX/2020 and for a process that should take no longer than 30 days, it has been over 240 days and I have neither received any investigation confirmation nor any result notices. The funny thing is, even the inaccurate personal information that was requested to be corrected, hasn't been done so. The fraud accounts are still showing on my report and it seems the bureaus are perfectly fine with violating my rights under the FCRA and the federal law. As stated, this is the last option before a lawsuit option is pursued."
Checking or savings account,"On or around XX/XX/2021 I filed a complaint about unauthorized charges to my joint account. 

The specialist XXXX XXXX XXXX took a report and described the initial process. She explained that a claim would be issued. The claim number provided was XXXX. She also indicated that a copy of the documentation would be available to me via email. By the way, I never received the form. 

A follow up message was sent on XX/XX/2021 to XXXX requesting an update. The information provided indicated that the claim was being processed. There was a mentioned of correspondence being sent to explain actions. 

The facts as follows : 1. Unauthorized use of card by merchant to renew membership products. 
2. Issuance of NSF fees due to XXXX 's approval. 
3. Dispute made to bank 4. Bank makes determination without providing customer with sufficient evidence of an investigation and policy application. 

The amounts in question are : XXXX  {$14.00} + NSF Fee ( {$36.00} ) XXXX {$39.00} + NSF Fee ( {$36.00} ) XXXX {$8.00} + NSF Fee ( {$36.00} ) The bank has sent threating letters and emails about closing the account. The frequency became overwhelming, almost every week. I consider these actions very oppressive and unethical. I will NOT close my account unless I am ready. It is your responsibility to respond to claims and disputes about banking matters. Lastly, I need to understand why are you deciding that my claim is not valid?"
Student loan,"I received a letter from Pioneer/XXXXXXXX  about a delinquent school loan that was owned by XXXX. 

I recently reached out to XXXX about 2 loans that are being reported on my credit report. 

These loans are being reported as late/delinquent as of XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$28000.00} and {$36000.00} with a loan open date of XX/XX/XXXX. 

I received a call from XXXX @ XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX. XXXX stated they received my request for debt validation and proof of legal ownership to collect on a debt. 
XXXX informed me that they only keep statements/documents for up to a year and at this time they dont have any statements or paperwork to send me. 

XXXX informed me that I do not owe them anything and my account has been transferred to Pioneer/XXXX as of XX/XX/XXXX. I informed XXXX that XXXX is still reporting on my credit as of XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX stated that XXXX is no longer reporting and to send him a copy of my Credit Report. I informed him I provided XXXX a copy on my last CFPB complaint. XXXX stated XXXX credit department will handle that and there is no one I could be transferred to in that Department. 

Going back to Pioneer I recently received a letter stating they are trying to collect on a delinquent student loan debt. Pioneer mailed this letter to a old address in XXXX Michigan. The letter contained no Date. The letter stated they are trying to collect on a debt on the Full amount of {$130000.00}. I have no idea why I owe this debt. 
I sent Pioneer a debt validation letter on XX/XX/XXXX informing them I am requesting a detailed statement of this debt and interest I owe a legal standing to collect this debt by showing me : 1. Your lawful authority to collect without my consent or 2. A copy of the original contract between myself and the original creditor where I agreed to the assignment of the debt ; with my ink signature. 

I am very confused to why XXXX is reporting one debt to the Credit bureaus when they informed me they dont have any paperwork to why I owe them a debt but then they are able to validate with the Credit bureaus that I owe them a debt they dont own. 

I believe that XXXX has sold/given my information to Pioneer since they couldnt supply a validation of debt. Pioneer has stated calling me to collect on a delinquent debt that I know nothing about. No one want to provide me with any correct information. 

I am unable to find suitable employment because of this credit blemish. I am unable to obtain credit because of this credit blemish."

My Business account was compromised and they would not assist. 

The inquiries are incorrect on my report and they failed to assist."

I have reached out to LoanCare about 15 times between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX to learn how I will be receiving my escrow refund and have not heard from them.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","The account in Question is with XXXX XXXX. The payment was delinquent and was eventually charged off. The problem is the XXXX XXXX is refusing to update the dates correctly. This account should have been removed from my credit reports in XXXX of this year, however now it is has once again continued to stay on my report and XXXX XXXX nor the XXXX Credit Bureaus will correct the dates and remove this information as they should according to the FCRA and Federal Law. 

The date of first delinquency on this account was XXXX, XXXX. This means that according to the FCRA and Federal Law this account should have been removed. I am not sure what sort of games XXXX XXXX is playing but every time I call to speak with a rep, no one will work with me. I have contacted and disputed this information with all XXXX credit reporting agencies and they continue to report the innacurate information. According to XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX Transunion now the date of first delinquency is XX/XX/XXXX. This means that this will now be on my reports for another year or more. 

I have tried every other means to correct this issue with all parties involved and no one will listen or cares enough to actually investigate as they should to see that this information has continued to change year after year. 

It is extremely frustrating that these company 's are allowed to do this to the average consumer like myself and hurt our chances of improving our positions in life. I am not excusing the fact that I allowed this account to go delinquent and then be charged off but this was over 7 and half years ago and I am doing everything in my power to do the right things. 

You can't keep changing the finish line because you want to harm consumers, it isn't right nor legal."

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","In XXXX, I called Citi Bank to defer credit card payment. Call was through a call center in the XXXX. ( I know I asked ) We communicated deferral of interest, fees, and payment like every other credit card company during the pandemic.

They put interest on credit card which was not agreed to.

I refused to pay unless they took it off.

Now, they have sent it to a collection agency and refused to negotiate the settlement of the debt. Kept saying call back next month. I would call. Call back next month. I would call. Call back next month. You get the picture.

This has put a mark on my credit report and costing me money to refinance my home.

I would like Citi to remove the bad credit mark and call me to settle the correct amount owed. Without the interest!"
Mortgage,"In XX/XX/2020 I engage with Golden 1 to refinance a loan they currently held. In XX/XX/2020 I raised my concern with the loan officer XXXX XXXX when I noticed property tax request for funds in the refinance at the same time that the original loan was set to pay property taxes. I was very clear that Golden 1 should coordinate as to which loan would pay the property taxes ( between the original mortgage and the refinance ) so as to avoid a double payment. Loan officer XXXX XXXX assured me a double payment would not be made. Golden 1, did in fact, double pay my property taxes ( approximately {$5100.00} out of the original loan, and the second approx. {$5100.00} out of the refinance loan ). Since XX/XX/2020, I have engaged in 36 telephone calls with Golden 1 in an attempt to obtain reimbursement.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",I was not notified regarding my investigating results. It has been 60 days and it is now violating the FCRA.
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",I reviewed my personal credit profile and unknown inquiry was made from this company multiple requests to remove said inquiries or provide documentation of it's accuracy has all been ignore by company.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",XXXX  and TransUnion were reporting two collections on my credit file with a company by the name of XXXX XXXX XXXX.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I had to file bankruptcy in XX/XX/XXXX  2020 due to income reduction. There were several credit card accounts that I had paid the balances in full prior to the filing. Some of these accounts were closed by the Grantors due to inactivity by me not using them. Others were closed by the Grantors based solely on the bankruptcy filing. My issue is ALL of these accounts are reflecting "" Account Included in Bankruptcy '' when there was no balance owed on the disputed accounts. I addressed this fact with the Credit Reporting Agency in my dispute filings. My credit report on all but one of the accounts in question doesn't even reflect my payment history on them. There is no mention that the accounts were paid off ; only that they are in bankruptcy. It's not right that these accounts are noted with negative remarks when the accounts were closed by Grantors when they were in good standing. I feel the remarks referencing "" bankruptcy '' should be removed on these accounts and the accounts be moved to the Satisfactory Accounts list in my report. I had added a Consumer Statement to my Credit Report stating the fact that these accounts were paid off. But, since it isn't seen until the very end of the Credit Report a Creditor would have to scan down through several pages of "" Inquiries '' to even know it exists! No one is going to see this statement."

The last report showed that it was indeed paid in full but also as an active account which is not the truth.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","There was an inquiry on my XXXX  credit report from XX/XX/2020, that was a result of identity theft. I discovered this during a review of my credit report. I called XXXX and they told me to contact the reporting company. I immediately put a freeze on my credit reports. I called Credco who made the inquiry and was told that the inquiry was from XXXX XXXX. I spoke to the dealership manager who told me about the applicant who applied for the credit. I verified my information and proved it was not me who applied for the credit. I spoke to Credco and was told to file a police report and a report with Identitytheft.gov. I did both of these and emailed them the reports asking them to remove the inquiry from my credit report. 

When I spoke to XXXX at Credco today, she told me that they now require me to send them a copy of my social security number, my driver 's license, and a copy of a utility bill. I told her that they never requested that information before and asked her if I sent them the additional documents if they would immediately remove the inquiry from my report and she was not able to guarantee me that they would. I told her that the information they are requesting is very sensitive and I do not feel comfortable releasing this information to a company that has not been authorized to receive this information and they could use it to further steal my identity now that they have a copy of my social security card, driver 's license, and utility bill. How can I be sure that they are not part of the identity theft scam? 

In essence, I told her that they are re-victimizing me by refusing to remove a fraudulent inquiry in spite of proof from a police report which they requested."

Agents told me that many people didn't put in offers because the garage that is located near the property did not come with the house. So with no acceptable offers, the property went into foreclosure and in XX/XX/XXXX it was sold for {$24000.00}. The mortgage never included the garage located near the property but, as of XX/XX/XXXX, there was a survey completed showing that the garage is actually part of the property. The garage was never insured and only used 1 stall of the garage being that the other stall was used by the owner of other property, and believed to be owned by the owner of other nearby property that shares driveway next to the property. The power is connected to the other property. The garage was never included on the mortgage or appraisal for the mortgage.

Which doesn't match my dates on when i had the card. I asked if i owed debt why this never appeared on my credit report or had any collections calling me, in which they could not answer. I also then asked for the card number which they gave me but said they had no statements that they could send me or information on the card or transactions as it was closed. I asked to show proof of this if i have to report it as income on my taxes in which they told me to hopefully i had some old statements.

Mortgage,"On XX/XX/2021, we completed the closing signing of legal documents on the refinancing of our mortgage to a lower rate. Before we started the signing, we gave the fiduciary agent our closing cost payment of {$110.00} via check # XXXX. 

On XX/XX/2021 we were notified that our closing cost was not paid at the time of closing by the title company, XXXX via secure email. I responded back with an email stating to their representative that we gave the funds of {$110.00} via check # XXXX to their fiduciary agent. 

I notified our Wells Fargo closing agent of the situation above via email and by phone on XX/XX/2021 of the situation. He, our Wells Fargo closing agent, filed a complaint with the executive office at Wells Fargo - complaint # XXXX. To date, a month later, XXXX states they have not found our paperwork. We received a letter from Wells Fargo that our rate lock would expire on XX/XX/2021. 

All of our sensitive personal information, checking account, SS # 's, Drivers Licenses, Credit reports, were included in the legal documents lost by the fiduciary agent from the title company. Legal documents executed by my husband and I along with the check paid at the time of our signing the legal documents have been lost! It's been a month now and we still don't know who has our information. Wells Fargo, as well as XXXX continue to be lax in moving to rectify this situation. We need to resign the paperwork and Wells Fargo needs to honor the contract or cancel our current mortgage. It is because of the Wells Fargo agent who stated, "" I can't tell you who do choose but this company, XXXX the most reputable of the three ''."
Mortgage,"I've submitted paperwork TWICE to the mitigation department and have not gotten any response. I have applied for a loan modification over 30 days ago.

Student loan,"I was falsely under the impression that this loan was under a deferment or forbearance like other student loans during this international crisis. Apparently, this did not apply to my private student loan. 

This company, Mohela, has put me in financial dire straights before, forced me into bankruptcy, and caused immense amounts of stress on my family due to their horrible communication practices and unwillingness to assist in any way. 

In XXXX, I filed for bankruptcy under pressure from a defaulted student loanwith Mohela. This student loan had fallen into bad standing as I had called Mohela to file for an economic forbearance option and was not informed I had only placed this option on the federal student loan held by Mohela, not the private student loans they also serviced. 

I came out of bankruptcy in XXXX, expecting to have accounts reset and be able to start with a fresh slate, and Mohela had not done any of these things as my other accounts with other creditors had. My forbearances were never reset, I was out of any available options when financial hardships arose, as they had already exhausted these options prior to and during the bankruptcy. 

When the bankruptcy period was over, and payments resumed for this loan, they were entirely too high for my family to afford. We contacted Mohela to put a payment adjustment in place, and they do for a time, but it expires, and each time, we file for a new modification. They want more and more information, and they do not contact us to tell us it's missing. You must log in to the website to find details. 

This year, as stated before, I erroneously thought this company would be giving us relief due to the pandemic, and instead, what they did could only be considered postal harassment. We tried to apply for a payment deferment in XXXX, a payment modification, anything to help get us through, and they denied us for missing income verification. 

Now we are receiving letters telling me I have defaulted on this loan, and to contact the legal department, during a global pandemic, during an unprecedented time, and during a time when student loans were supposed to be offering relief. 

I am feeling backed into a corner here. They offer no options to help."

XXXX ( Supervisor ) call me around XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX to advise she would correct the reporting by sending the correct information to the credit bureaus. She even emailed me a letter from Midland Mortgage stating the information was inaccurate and should be removed from my credit report. I have a copy of the letter. My chief concern is that even after Midland Mortgage assured me they would rectify the inaccurate reporting, the credit bureaus still to this day are receiving information back from Midland Mortgage that my account is 90 days and 120 days past due for XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. Midland Mortgage must immediately correct their system and update the credit bureaus. Due to this inaccurate reporting, I was denied for a mortgage.

The lady told me the payoff amount which I paid, however the account couldn't be closed until the payment cleared. Which is not true for revolving credit lines, they can be closed with a balance. A few months later I opened a plain envelope to discover that I had a balance of several dollars. I called and they could not waive due to previous late fees waivers. I explained it was due to bank error and I am not responsible for a bank mistake. They had taken my payment as an account payoff. I asked for a return call from a supervisor since none was available. I never received one, nor did I receive one the next time I asked. I am trying to refinance my home and due to the impact of the delinquency on my credit card I did not qualify for the cheapest loan. I had to take one that is {$3000.00} more expensive in closing costs. The refinance can not close until this balance is gone. I called again today and paid the balance since they refuse to resolve the {$1.00} residual interest error that is now {$8.00} with more fees and interest. This is predatory and unacceptable practices. I would like the delinquency removed from my credit report and the {$8.00} refunded to me."
Debt collection,"On XXXX XXXX I received a response from pro collect that they would settle for XXXX instead of XXXX. Which I was thankful for that. But I called and reached out to XXXX XXXX as it stated to in the response, reaching her was difficult I called on multiple days and none of the representative would transfer me to her.. so I submitted a complaint on here again and left a number and XXXX XXXX called and we talked bout resolving the balance. I told her that I couldnt pay the balance of XXXX in full because I was out of work due to covid 19 and she gave me until XXXX to email her on what I could do regarding balance. I emailed her letting her know I still wouldnt be able to pay balance in full. I never received a reply back to the email nor a call. I have been calling still trying to resolve the matter and nothing. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter in the mail stating that I could call and make a pay arrangement. So I called today on XXXX XXXX and was told I couldnt make a payment arrangement and that they will continue to affect my credit report negatively. That a payment is required by XXXX or negative remarks will be added to my credit report.. I have tried over the years to settle this debt and with no resolution. Just rude representative and no compassion or understanding."
Debt collection,"I submitted a complaint on XX/XX/XXXX. I received no communication from the company until XXXX via email at XXXX XXXX. I provided a complete response at XXXX XXXX  in which I received no reply via email. I then received a second email at XXXX that they had received my CFPB complaint and subsequently closed it without providing an adequate remedy. Additionally, this indicates that the company did not take this complaint investigation seriously and did not take the time to research the issue. 

As I stated, in the original complaint, this account is fraudulent. Pursuant to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15USC 1692g. The company responded to this complaint via email and subsequently on this complaint. The representative stated, "" Our records show that Spotloan made a loan in your name on XX/XX/XXXX, in the amount of {$800.00}. I have independently verified that certain application information matches your name but can not complete my report without your help. '' This is also a violation as per the FDCPA. 

I have not received any validation of such information. I have requested to be provided with competent evidence that I have any legal obligation to this debt. I have not receive any. Spotloan also wrote : "" Additionally, while you assert we have violated the FDCPA please know that Spotloan is not a debt collector under the FDCPA. Further, we have not owned your loan as of XX/XX/XXXX, we are not affiliated with the XXXX XXXX, and have not attempted to collect on your debt since it was sold to XXXX XXXX "" This is another violation of my rights. This is an attempt to collect a debt and as such, Spotloan is liable for this violation under the FDCPA. This office has reported invalidated information to all 3 Major credit bureaus ( XXXX, XXXX, or XXXX  XXXX for five years, which constitute additional fraud under both Federal and State Laws. Due to this fact, the negative marks found on my credit reports by Spotloan and the company that the alleged debt was sold to, is Violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, Violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, and Defamation of Character. Further, the information that is being reported is also inaccurate per the companies response. Again, this is fraud and violation of the FDCPA. Pursuant to 15 USC 1692c.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I have been attempting to file disputes of my credit report to Citi Bank. All of my credit reports, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX  do not have the correct monthly balance. They stopped reporting to the credit bureaus after my XXXX statement. They have attempted to start reporting the XXXX balance but it does not match my credit card statement. I have file disputes with all of the credit bureaus and have had daily calls into Citi bank to try and get this fixed. II have sent in several faxes to their dispute department and they have come back with "" inssufient information or No issue found ''. For the Months of XXXX and XXXX, all my reports are showing "" no data available '' Citi bank has not been helping me, and seems like they think there is nothing wrong. I have about 15 different credit cards and this has never happened before. It should be a simple fix since they have copies of my credit card statements, but they will not fix it correctly."
Mortgage,"I have been trying to work with my lender but all they do is give me the run around. I have provided everything that they need and they still continue to ask for more documents that is not required. 

Their intake team or underwriters have had my loan under review for over 4 months asking for more and more documents. Each time letting documents expire and then asking for more."

Credit card or prepaid card,"In working with Citi cards. They reduced my line of credit down from XXXX to XXXX to the amount that i owed on the account on XXXX of 2020. Then they reported on my credit report that i had maxed out my line of credit. I get it covid and the need to protect their interest. But over the course of the next 11 months i paid on time and tried to pay more than the minimum. On XXXX I paid XXXX down on what i owed on the account and on XXXX they reduced my line of credit down again to the amount that i owed of XXXX. 

Their response was that my reduction was due to my credit score. Well my score stayed flat and even their fico score show only 1 point of movement. Well i ask these questions of citi card 1- If i make another large payment will my line of credit be reduced again ( their response was that they were not sure ) 2- I asked what step i needed to do to help increase my credit score with their company ( their responded was that they do not have any steps or process to improve the score. ) 3 - I asked if i had any late payments or covid paused on the account and they said i has a clean payment record for the past 5 year but they are not sure how this impacts my score.

4 i asked if there was another covid stimulus payment and i applied it to my account what would happen -- they responded that they would love the payment and were not sure if my line of credit would remain the same. 

Long and short citi cards at XXXX are destroying my credit and making it difficult to recover my credit score.

The reason for the large payment was to reduce the amount that i owed and get the maxed out line of credit off of my credit file. I certainly did my part my saving and making my payment on time so this line of acting is damaging to anyone who is trying to recover.

The fact that i am concerned with is that there is a lot of other people that once they are credit line maxed out their credit interest rate also will go up. I have seen other card that i have go up a point or 2 just because of this type of action."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Hello, I have spoken to Governor XXXX XXXX XXXX office which confirmed that per the XXXX website, all Californian 's are under the protection against negative credit reporting and lists my bank, CitiGroup ( Citibank ) as an institution that acknowledges this ordinance. However, Citibank has reported 5 of my accounts negatively throughout XXXX. 
1 ) I have 2 citi credit cards reported as 30 days late in XXXX, XXXX XXXX of XXXX. Citi is aware that I had called 3 times in XXXX to request a covid deferment and they replied that no such program was available. My 3rd call is logged as XX/XX/XXXX wnere no program was avaialble. They launched a program on XX/XX/XXXX after my account was posted late and even after being enrolled in a covid deferment, my 2 cards were reported as late. 

2 ) My 3rd Citi card is reported as late XXXX XXXX and then reported charged off. They would not enroll this card without first requiring it be current after I explained that I was impacted by covid as early as XX/XX/XXXX. 

3 ) My 4th card, Best Buy, backed by CitiGroup, was reported as "" Closed by issuer, Never late '' which has a substantial negative impact to credit. There was no reason for this card to have otherwise closed. 

I have made several calls into Citibank. I have reached out to the Executive Response Team and I have not received a resolution. The Governor 's office has requested that I followup with the outcome of this as we believe this to be a wide spread concern against the credit protection ordinance. 

I appreciate your help.

I also remembered last year I didn't receive a paper document XXXX Form for XXXX, I was able to call to get some automatic reply on how much interest I've paid for XXXX but I would like to have a paper documentation, Form XXXX, but the whole website is not functioning. 

I checked XXXX, there is numerous complaints about this company. I am worried I am paying monthly to a fake entity and I would like to get a statement monthly and also my yearly statement in paper."
Mortgage,"I paid for the loan application fee. During the approval process our company merged with another company and my wife transferred her ownership to me. The entire time I stayed a W2 employee. they stated we suffered a income loss and wouldn't approve the loan. I have a credit score of XXXX, no debt but the two houses and a car lease. Income did not change. I think they figured out that this second house was on a leased lot with GA Power and they could not follow through with the rate they promised. They transferred my flood insurance to them as the beneficiary before we even closed. I had to track down my insurance agent and switch it back to my existing lender. Now that they denied the claim they won't cancel the loan request and stop requesting information to complete the process. I have left 6 phone messages, 10 emails and 10 text messages. I was assured on friday it would be taken care of by close of business. Still getting requests. Horrible response, will not return calls and will not complete what they promise. Horrible experience."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",I made an online purchase at XXXX using my store card on XX/XX/2019 and subsequently returned some items from the order within the same month. The balance on my card was not updated correctly to reflect the return and interest was applied to the amount of the returned item. That amount was not paid because I contested it with the credit card company and later a penalty was applied for not paying the interest. They inevitably reversed the amounts when they looked into the charges meanwhile they reported my payment history as 60+ days late in XX/XX/2019 and reduced my credit line. First of all it is impossible to be 60+ days late when not even 60 days could transpire between the purchase date and the month of their reporting. Second of all I was never late as the amount was never owed. Several attempts to resolve with the company have yielded zero results.
Mortgage,"Hi, First off, my loan process was started on XX/XX/XXXX with XXXX XXXX with Sage Mortgage and I specifically selected Sage over XXXX  XXXX because of his wonderful communication and customer service from XXXX. I was able to upload all necessary documentation by XX/XX/XXXX and everything seemed to be going smoothly until XX/XX/XXXX. At this time, my emails and calls remained unanswered until XX/XX/XXXX. This was due to the fact that XXXX was no longer my loan officer. This was never communicated with me, nor contact information provided for the new loan officer. Instead my emails and phone calls simply went unanswered. From there, XXXX XXXX XXXX, my loan processor was the only one working on the loan and it seemed as if she could not access the information I had given to XXXX because duplicate information was requested. Even more concerning, I was told that the information I provided about my condominiums insurance policy was incorrect. So I contacted the insurance company with information given to Sage in order to attain the master policy. They were able to provide this the same day. Considering this is a service that Sage is charging me for, it is odd that I needed to do it for them. 

Thankfully on XX/XX/XXXX I was assigned a new loan officer, XXXX XXXX. His communication was great at first except he, like XXXX, was requesting information that I had already provided weeks ( if not, a month ) earlier. Unfortunately, that same day all communication from XXXX halted and he was unable to get a hold of via email, phone call, or text. Not until XX/XX/XXXX did he contact me again to let me know he couldn't communicate with me because of an issue with his licensure in Colorado. He then halted communication that same day and once again no communication has been provided about my loan. 

My rate has now been extended twice by XXXX. After multiple attempts at talk to a supervisor or manager for months I've yet had success. Please help me figure out what is going on with my loan."
Mortgage,"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  was Loan originator. They were the worst mortgage company I have ever had to deal with, they were very litigious with a legal department incessantly seeking opportunity to assess legal fees and force default. The Loan was sold to Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing who have turned out to be an even worst nightmare. 
They routinely assess fees basically for just holding the loan. If your property taxes or insurance goes up watch out as it will be a XXXX to assess additional fees and they will never communicate any of this beforehand and filing an appeal or compliant is useless. They both will undoubtedly do well in the current COVID afftected economic downturn and many will lose their homes and property to their unfair practices."
Debt collection,"I've sent multiple letters to this agency about this not being my account. After being advised by identitytheft.gov, I've completed and sent a fraud affidavit via certified mail. I can see they received it, but nothing has changed. See supporting documents. Even the USPS tracking. My official complaint is against WAYPOINT. My information was used to obtain an apartment, cell phone, and an auto loan with my ex-partner. I am a victim of identity theft and have put this off for too long. I've completed the proper steps, 1. notify creditors 2. police report 3. informed the state of Texas. The individual I've suspected for this theft is now deceased, and the police department said to contact the federal trade commission to seek relief. These companies disregard laws and dont care whos credit or lives they impact."
Mortgage,"My mortgage has changed companies several times. The most recent company, LoanCare, has been servicing my mortgage for several years. In XXXX, they decided to stop applying my payments to my account because it had the old account number. However, I was not made aware of this until XXXX. I have made every payment to them and have submitted proof of those payments MANY times. However, they refuse to acknowledge my payments and keep delaying any resolution. I have spoken and email them many times and can not get any answers. My credit has been ruined and I fear I am about to get foreclosed on."
Debt collection,"To Whom it may concern, I recently challenged the validity of CREDIT ACCEPTANCE CORPORATION # XXXX ( Collection ) account thats being reported on my most recent credit report. 
Upon challenging this, XXXX  ( credit bureau ) deleted the account based on the lack of ability to properly verify all reported information being accurate. 
I noticed as A result of challenging this account with your company you have verified this same account. It is my understanding that the creditor reports the same information to all credit bureaus as expected under FCRA, if this is true I am requesting the information you used to verify this account in writing. 
If such documents can not be produced please DELETE this account from my credit report immediately."
Mortgage,I attempted to refinance my mortgage through AmeriSave Mortgage company. I received an initial loan estimate with a closing cost of {$5600.00}. I was told that here was an application fee of {$500.00} but was told that that would go toward the appraisal so don't worry. Appraisal was done and a closure disclosure was eventually emailed with a closing cost of {$8000.00}. Almost @ XXXX difference. I had 5 days to sign documents or my loan process would be closed. I have been calling to discuss the change for the last 2 weeks and no one answers the phone throughout the company. Have left over 20 messages with the loan officer and company. There is no way I would sign anything without first talking to someone. I've used different phones to call from thinking that maybe they wouldn't recognize my number. I guess that they assumed that since I paid my {$500.00} I would be pressured into signing the documents so I wouldn't lose my money. The old bait and switch.
Credit card or prepaid card,"Citibank Credit Cards on XX/XX/2020 significantly lowered my credit limits on the Costco Visa ( by XXXX ) and Citi XXXX Mastercard ( by XXXX ). 

Their letter stated that it was due to an unpaid high balance on another card - this was the XXXX XXXX XXXX identity theft fraud that I previously reported and was trying to resolve with XXXX. 

I was current and paying on time and my accounts were long standing accounts in good standing with Citibank. 

As a result of Citi 's actions, my accounts at Citi were then shown as at 90 % + credit utilization further deteriorating my credit score. 

I have since paid off the whole balance of each of the citibank cards, but the damage to both my credit limits and credit score continues."
Checking or savings account,"Balance went down for a month, they charged me 3 times. Called multiple times never got back to me. Also said they will refund but never did. They stated some bogus FDIC regulation DD, which states nothing about charging 3 times for one month drop of minimum balance."

Mortgage,I put my mortgage into forebearance.

Mortgage,"I am currently in the process of selling my mobile home. My current lender states that they can not provide me with a copy of my title that my buyer needs in order to close. Because of this, I had to get a copy from XXXX. In order for XXXX to release a copy of my title, they need a letter from the mortgage company saying they have permission to print out the title ( being that they are the lienholder ). Which at that point, the original title would be sent to them and a copy would be given to me so I will be able to close. The mortgage company refused to send a letter for permission to XXXX. They are holding up the sale on my mobile home."
Mortgage,"The loan was originated at XXXX and then XXXX then sold to Specialized Loan Servicing. The original loan doesn't call for a loan payoff quote fee, however when I applied for a refinance with another lender a loan pay off fee was charged to my XXXX statement of {$25.00}. I called Specialized Loan Servicing company and I got a very rude CSR who told me they can charge me anything they want to charge me and I have to pay it. I was told as my loan was purchased that old loan contract is no longer governed. I asked for a supervisor and was denied to speak to anyone else. 
I feel this company is cheating people and charging fees they should not be allowed to charge or at least are not allowed by the constraints of the original contracts they purchased. 
I wonder how many people have been cheated like this by this company?"
Checking or savings account,"I closed my checking account sometime in XX/XX/XXXX. There was a remaining balance of some $ XXXX in the account. When I called to close the account I was assured this amount would be mailed to me by check. I asked the representative to please confirm the mailing address that the check would be sent to, as the mailing address ( PO Box ) is different from the physical address on my account. No check. 

I called Citi again in XX/XX/XXXX, and was told the check was returned to them as undeliverable. Citi mailed the check to my physical address ( which doesn't accept mail ). I explained that I told the first agent this exact thing the first time and was assured it would be sent to the correct place. This new agent told me that the mailing address on my account was my physical address. I explained this was wrong ( and an error on their side ), because my debit card and PIN when I opened the account were correctly delivered to my mailing address, and I double-checked with the first agent anyway! This agent relented, and again assured me it would be sent out to my mailing address. No check. 

I called Citi again in XX/XX/XXXX, and was again assured by the agent that he would take personal responsibility that it was resolved and sent to my mailing address. No check. 

All of this information is in their call logs and notes on my account, and each agent could see the issue and that I had called before and the check wasn't delivered. 

It is now XXXX XXXX, and I'm done. I want my $ XXXX. I want them to mail it to my mailing address, or hand deliver it, I don't care. Please help! Thank you!"

Emails can disappear right in front of my eyes and password reset emails will not come to my device. Settings change themselves the second i stop looking at the screen. 
All my personal health information has been having problems getting to my health care provider. Including calls for appointments. We are trying to verify all appointments with XXXX and the phone company for billing purposes and i am having a hard time getting a response everytime i send them email. I receive phone calls from someone claiming to be XXXX XXXX when i access my health care app. This must be a crime and fraud and i hope we can find out why this illegal account and identity activity is happening and who else is using a device with this information ... was my phone a clone or was the someone elses original phone a clone. I consider this a major crime and this type of activity will definatly cost lives durring a pandemic. Having someone know everything you do online and possible XXXX XXXX  crimes. 
I need an answer to this situation ... i was given false information by a health care provider and was given a tetnus shot when i asked for an anti body test. I felt like my body was going into XXXX  XXXX  ... somehow i survived and want to see this type of activitity ended. 
I am concerbed for all parties that have been given a cloned phone and can tell someone is extremely frustrated on the other end of my device. The setting constantly changing right after i change them. My password not working for the second device a minute later, my XXXX  XXXX  password changing and XXXX password changing. 
I need your help in this situation because im not sure my mother is aware of the illegal account activity and i cant seem to convince her it is happening. 

A very concerned customer and XXXX used, XXXX XXXX XXXX I am concerned my identification that i have sent over the internet may also have been compromised and intercepted when i tried to verify My identity on XXXX.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","The Army Air Force Exchange Service ( AAFES ) refuses to stop reporting a derogatory item against my personal credit report despite presentation of documentation that proves the existence of mitigating circumstances tied to active duty military service. After I was ordered to active duty from the reserve component, an automatic allotment that I had setup to make automatic payments against my open XXXX XXXX XXXX ( credit card offered and managed by AAFES ) did not immediately carry over. I was ordered to attend an intense military training pipeline that spanned approximately 20 months and included multiple short-notice relocations during that timeframe ( see attached sets of orders ). Additionally, the Creditor is in violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act because I was never provided prior notification of pending material changes to my credit report. It was only after reaching my final base that I learned something was wrong. One of my paychecks was approximately XXXX smaller than normal. Upon reconciliation of the reserve and active pay systems, the XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) automatically sent a single payment to close the remaining outstanding balance still open against the account held by the named Creditor ( reference the attached Leave and Earnings Statement ). In effect, by the time I realized something was wrong, the Creditor had already sent the account into collections. The Creditor claims to have sent notification ; however, the last address they had on file was my reserve unit HQ building -- even though this makes no sense as the XXXX XXXX is a personal credit card requiring a residential address during the application/sign up process ( which I provided ). Personnel at my reserve unit were not able to verify receipt of any personal notifications addressed to me from AAFES during my absence. 

I have attempted to work directly with the Creditor and all three Credit Reporting Agencies XXXX see attached email correspondence and dispute letters XXXX. I have even retained legal representation ( see attached legal notices from XXXX XXXX XXXX ). The Creditor states that the decision rests with the CRAs. The CRAs state that the decision rests with the Creditor. All involved parties refuse to coordinate and simply shift the responsibility. I have already filed a complaint against the CRAs, but was unable to also list AAFES. This complaint is specifically intended for the named Creditor."

Then to make matters even worse the XXXX  was defective costing me an additional {$1600.00} to replace that broken screw that the defective XXXX  kept breaking on the XXXX. The technician explained it like this. The back of the XXXX  was not touching the XXXX  so my wife would bite down and the XXXX would go down acting like a lever breaking that same screw each year. Right now he has taken {$26000.00} from me for this {$2000.00} XXXX, for a full XXXX. To fix the XXXX  he had the technician cut off the XXXX XXXX.

She said well I will tell him you dispute this charge but he says you owe it, if he says you owe it, then you owe it. since you said you will not pay it we will ruin your credit.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","In XXXX of 2017, I opened a checking account with Bank of America. In XXXX of 2017, I deposited a check into the account that ended up being drawn on an account that had just been closed, although I did not know it. My account was immediately frozen. I called customer service, and they told me what had happened and suggested that I go speak to the manager of the bank branch where I had opened the account, who should be able to lift the freeze. 

When I went to the bank to see the manager, I was accompanied by my XXXX  granddaughters, who are XXXX. The manager stared at them, and it was obvious to me that because he was white, he was making a XXXX judgment on me ( I'm also white ) for having XXXX grandchildren. He was very rude to me and told me that because the deposit I made was returned, it caused several checks I had written to bounce. Although the account was not overdrawn, because I had bounced a check in the first 30 days, he said that bank had to close my account. The manager returned to me the money that was still in the account, and closed it during my visit. He assured me that there would be no negative reporting ramifications from the closure, as it was not my fault. 

Recently, I attempted to open an account with a different bank and was denied. I obtained a copy of my XXXX  Report ( as recommended by the denying bank ) to see why I had been denied, and I noted that Bank of America had reported me to XXXX in 2017, indicating they had closed my account due to "" suspected fraud ''. This is completely inaccurate. The XXXX report also indicated that I had an unpaid amount owed to BofA as a result of the closed account, which is also inaccurate. 

I contacted BofA several times to request that they remove the false information from XXXX, but the customer service reps I spoke with said they were unable to do so, but could not provide me any valid reason why ( as they agreed with me as to why my account had been closed and confirmed I did not owe BofA any money ). 

The false and negative report by Bank of America to XXXX is preventing me from opening any bank accounts, which I need to do for my small business. I am being harmed severely every day that the false information remains on the report."

For this reason I am unable to access any online services for this loan, including my account number, online payment, and most importantly auto-pay. My only way to pay XXXX was to pay over the phone when they called me. They didn't call in XXXX, I can only assume this was due to COVID. I contacted XXXX  on multiple occasions but they were never able to fix the issue. 

In XX/XX/XXXX I realized that XXXX XXXX were reporting a late payment on my account from XX/XX/XXXX. At that time I attempted to reach-out to XXXX XXXX via phone at least 5 times to address the reported late payment. I was told by the front line customer service reps that there was nothing they could do to resolve the reported late payment, despite the incorrect information on my account, and that a manager would call me back. The managers called at times when I was unavailable, so I returned their calls leaving voicemails each time. I never received additional follow-up from them. 

In addition to calls directly to XXXX XXXX, I've sent them a letter outlining the situation and asking them to change their credit bureau reporting. I've also reported the error through the credit bureau dispute processes. Unfortunately, none of these efforts have led to resolution of this issue. 

XXXX XXXX 's inaccurate reporting is significantly negatively impacting my life. Tonight I attempted to finance a new cell phone ( only a {$1000.00} purchase ) and was denied by two different banks. If this one late payment were removed from my account XXXX XXXX estimates my credit score increases from 660  to the 750 range.

The date of first delinquency on this account was XXXX, XXXX. This means that according to the FCRA and Federal Law this account should have been removed.

It is extremely frustrating that these company 's are allowed to do this to the average consumer like myself and hurt our chances of improving our positions in life.

She stated that it is their policy that no additional waivers can take place after the two waivers for the prior months. This was not discussed with me by the prior Customer Services Representatives that did the initial waivers. 

I am disputing this charge because I have been faithful in making my payments on time for many years that I have held a Sears Credit Card. These late fees and interest charges were not due to my error but due to the lag in postal service, COVID pandemic and the lack of personnel to process payments issued to Sears Mastercard."

I later confirmed that the {$2400.00} in funds was withdrawn successfully from my account, with plenty of available funds, leaving {$290.00}. This is still documented on my account, as documented in the attached screenshot of the mobile app. 

The following morning, despite more than {$4100.00} being deposited into the account, I learned that the check was "" returned '' and an overdraft fee of {$35.00} was charged. 

After speaking with several representatives at the bank, XXXX ( XXXX ) confirmed that the bank erred in several important ways, and is clearly misleading customers about their available balances. XXXX confirmed that she would file an internal complaint on the following issues, and I stated that I would do the same. 

These issues are : Mobile and web apps - The bank 's own apps are providing incorrect and misleading Account Balances. The bank claims that, only on the web app, there is a separate area of the app that shows which checks have "" posted '' and therefore, what the actual account balance is. This is incredibly misleading to average consumers, such as myself. I have been a customer of this bank for more than a decade, and this has never happened before. I have attached a screenshot which confirms that {$290.00} was remaining in the account after the check was withdrawn, proving that the check should not have been returned. 

Overdraft Fee - I was told that the Overdraft Fee can not be returned to me while "" processing. '' XXXX confirmed that this is incorrect and she returned it to me. 

Overdraft Protection -My Overdraft Protection was linked to a closed savings account, yet I was not told this, so the checking account did not pull from the correct account when it needed to. XXXX confirmed that this is incorrect and misleading. 

Notification - I was not notified in a timely manner about the overdraft. XXXX confirmed that this needs to be corrected."
Mortgage,"I have an issue that requires your offices attention. Im a premier client and have maintained a 25+ year relationship with Bank of America . I recently refinanced my existing JUMBO home 1st mortgage with Bank of America and also maintain a HELOC with BofA. During the refinancing process ( for the mortgage ) I requested a modest increase to my unused HELOC ( figuring it would be easier to get it all done at once ). I was told by my mortgage banker ( XXXX XXXX XXXX NMLS # XXXX ) that it would be easier to increase the HELOC after we closed the first mortgage. Now I am being told ( post closing of refinancing ) that an increase to my HELOC would require an exception that BofA can not accommodate. This would have been helpful information to know prior to closing and paying nearly {$50000.00} of closing and refinancing costs. I find it unconscionable that after working with Bank of America in good faith and incurring massive costs that I now find myself forced to seek out an alternative HELOC AFTER Bank of America effectively locked me into a mortgage refinancing at a significant UPFRONT cost to me. I was clearly mislead. My refinancing business was sought after by several competing institutions but I decided to stay with BofA given the long relationship. 

Again, my HELOC request was raised during the 1st mortgage home refinancing process and I was told we will handle it after the mortgage is closed. At no time was I made aware there may be the need for exceptions."

My credit is current and well-managed. I disagree with BOA 's assessment of my credit utilization, but there appears to be little that I can do about this issue. However, I adamantly object to the remaining two reasons that BOA cited -- delinquencies and finance companies on my credit report. 

There were no delinquencies or finance companies listed on my credit report when I requested the credit increase in XXXX of XXXX.

Mr. XXXX failed to satisfy my request to specifically state exactly what delinquencies and finance companies it identified. 

I faithfully review my credit file at the start of each year because I do not like surprises. I know exactly what is on my credit report. All errors or items of concern that I find are immediately reported for correction, which is why I am requesting that BOA/Mr. XXXX clearly identify by name the items that it cited as the reason for its decision. BOA is either deliberately misrepresenting the information it alleges is in my credit report or it is reviewing inaccurate information -- information that is not on the reports that I review every single year.

I contacted the collection agency, the three credit bureaus asking them to remove the collection account from my report per the fair credit reporting act section XXXX. Only XXXX removed the account within 4 days. Both XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX started a "" general dispute '' tat takes 30 days and they refused to discuss the reason behind that. I have uploaded all the supporting documents to all involved parties and I feel thatXX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX are hurting me by keeping this fraudulent information on my credit profile."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I just pulled my credit report, and discovered that a late payment was reported on XX/XX/2018 for my account # XXXX. 

Due to various circumstances at the time I fear that I would be unable to make my upcoming payments on time, because of this I applied to put the loan on forbearance which I was approved for. I was instructed that I would be debited a portion of the payment to activate it but apparently the payment was never received according to what a rep told me over the phone which is why the loan was not put on forbearance and why I have this late payment. They charged the wrong bank account! I did everything I was suppose to this is completely their fall and they wont take responsibility for it!"
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I keep sending letters in regard to a bankruptcy that they claim has been verified by XXXX XXXX but the information they are reporting does not match the XXXX XXXX Report, Transunion, XXXX  or XXXX  report. I also looked on Pacer and none of the information matches. 

I don't understand how all this information is being verified but none of the information is being reported the same from any of the Credit Reporting agencies and I keep getting ignored by TransUnion, XXXX and XXXX  and XXXX XXXX about this. 

Name My name has only been XXXX XXXX XXXX. TransUnion has a reported name of XXXX XXXX XXXX which is completely inaccurate and needs to be removed. 

Bankruptcy TransUnion, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX all have different Docket # 's All credit reporting agencies are reporting different Court names and addresses which do not match XXXX  confirmation # XXXX dated XX/XX/20 investigation was incomplete and did not list any information for the Bankruptcy being reported. 

File for XXXX  shows court name Federal - but no information was provided in the investigation results. Report was blank that was provided by XXXX  in there investigation results provided on XX/XX/20.

How can I not get an answer to any of the letters being sent to TransUnion. Why was my report incomplete from XXXX. Why isn't XXXX XXXX telling me how they are getting this information if they clearly have not verified this information with anyone since I had to reach out to the court and have told me that they do not verify this information. So how can any of this information be accurate?"
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","On XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX  via regarding the accuracy of the charged-of account that they're reporting to the Transunion and XXXX. 
More specifically, my concern is : 1.This account is only reporting charge-offs in my payment history from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. 2. All my good payments history has been deleted from XXXX up until this account was charged off in XXXX. 3 XXXX is reporting a charged off in XXXX and XXXX, Transunion is not. 4 I made a payment in XXXX, so XXXX shouldn't show a charge off in XXXX. 5 How can there be only charge offs reporting but no 30, 60, 90 day lates?? 6 XXXX is reporting a removal date of this account XX/XX/XXXX and Transunion is reporting a removal date on XX/XX/XXXX. This is confusing, there can only be one removal date. 7 The date of first delinquency is not reporting. This account is incomplete, inaccurate and unfair therefore it must be deleted. 
Also, I asked for validation and verification under the FCRA to insure the accuracy of this account and was denied by XXXX XXXX XXXX  for this information which is a violation under the FRCA and th FDCA. See Creditor response letter to verification request."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",My credit scores are way too low for my excellent credit history. It seems like the bureaus are getting kick backs from financial institutions to keep the consumer down to pay the very high interest rate loans.
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",I called XXXX to remove two inquiries off of my credit report and they refuse to help me. The two inquiries are fraudulently. The first one was from XXXX XXXX XX/XX/2019 and the second one was from XXXX on XXXX XXXX. I really need these off my credit report with XXXX.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","XXXX has been reporting incorrect payment history to all three credit bureaus. My loan and been in deferment and forbearance all of 2020 until now, but the mortgage company is reporting me being 60+ days late to all three bureaus. I have called them in and I have sent them a letter in XX/XX/2020 asking them to correct my payment history. I can not be late if there haven't been any payments due. 

They are violating the rules of the FCRA, the CARES ACT, and the Fair billing act by reporting incorrect payment history to Transunion, XXXX, and XXXX. Each bureau is reporting different payment information because XXXX  refuses to fix their reporting. 

I have included my letter to them requesting that they correct the payment history, the forbearance letter from them, and a copy of my credit report showing the incorrect payment history."

Checking or savings account,"I have accounts with several banks and credit unions. All banks and credit unions provided my tax documents electronically ( usually a downloadable document from their website ). This is true for various tax documents ( XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, etc. ). The Navy Federal Credit Union, however, does not provide an electronic copy on their website. 

I called to ask for the electronic copy, but the customer service manager responded that the Navy Federal Credit Union only sends paper versions by mail. I explained that every other financial institution provided electronic copies, which should be standard after the pandemic started 10 months ago. The Navy Federal Credit Union refused. 

I explained that every other business has adopted to operating during the pandemic by providing documents electronically and that I would need the electronic copy to respond to requests by the IRS by email. This is quite frustrating and antiquated. 

Does the CFPB provide guidance to financial institutions for providing electronic copies of documents, especially during the pandemic? Thanks very much."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","XXXX ; XXXX  and Transunion should not be reporting that I am ( 30 ) days late on the XXXX partial account number XXXX. ( Please see page attached from my credit report. ) This account has since been paid in full. I was charged {$2.00} in interest AFTER the account had been closed. This charging of interest after the account was closed is ridiculous. These lates reporting are seriously harming my credit score and these lates need to be removed from my credit report. I have attached a copy of my XXXX statement for XXXX showing the account was closed and I have also attached a copy of the XXXX XXXX statement which shows the interest of {$2.00} being charged. It is a violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act not to report accurate information on a credit report. Again, please remove these lates that are reporting."

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","This company is without a doubt one of the most unscrupulous ones out there. I have constant issues with them especially with regards to them failing to apply payments, changing due dates, adjusting available credit weeks after payments already cleared. 

I was enrolled in 3 different programs for covid been there for 8 years never late and i paid as well based on their directives and they reported me late for XXXX and XX/XX/2020. Never been late in 8 years didnt start now. 

Just because they repeatedly lie about it i started screenshots of everything nightly. They are now saying i didnt make a payment before XX/XX/XXXX which you clearly see attached i made the payments and more and they fraudulently added on a late fee yet again. They also have yet to refund a cancelled transaction from XX/XX/2020 which is just how they are - beware"
